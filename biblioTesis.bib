  booktitle = {{$8^{th}$ International Conference on Turbochargers and Turbocharging}},
  year = {2006},
  organization = {IMechE},
  abstract = {The inlet blade angle of radial turbines is almost invariably fixed
  in the radial direction to avoid imposing additional bending stresses
  at the blade tips. However, a small number of published studies have
  shown that changing the inlet blade angle can shift the efficiency
  characteristic to bring improvements at off-design conditions. Such
  a move in the efficiency characteristic would benefit turbocharger
  performance where the turbine typically experiences lower than optimum
  velocity ratios while accelerating during engine transients. This
  paper details a numerical study of varying inlet blade angle. A 1D
  performance prediction routine has been used to forecast changes
  in the overall performance characteristics of a turbine with non-radial
  inlet blading, revealing a shift in the peak efficiency point and
  an increase in efficiency at lower values of velocity ratio (U/C)
  when using a back swept blade angle of 30∞. The numerical modelling
  strategy, which was fully validated against existing experimental
  measurements, was used to verify the findings of the 1D analysis
  and show how the back swept blade angle significantly reduced regions
  of flow recirculation at inlet during off-design operation. FEA revealed
  stress levels up to 51% of the material yield strength at the inlet
  region of the pressure side on the 30∞ back swept blade. A brief
  review of new nanocomposite material technologies is presented to
  demonstrate the potential they provide for increased freedom in aerodynamic
  blade design.},

  on well-established SIMPLE and PISO algorithms. The schemes are applied
  to the solution of unsteady laminar flow around a square cylinder
  and steady laminar flow over a backward-facing step. The implicit
  treatment and the performance of the various schemes are evaluated
  by using benchmark solutions with a small time step. Three different
  second-order-accurate time derivatives based on different time levels
  are presented. The different time derivatives are applied to the
  various schemes under consideration. Overall the PISO scheme was
  found to predict accurate results and was robust. However, for small
  time step values, alternative schemes can predict accurate results
  for approximately half the computational cost. The choice of time
  derivative proved to be very significant in terms of the accuracy
  and robustness of a scheme. Significantly, the one-sided forward
  differencing scheme was the most successful used in conjunction with
  a strongly implicit-based algorithm. However, a greater degree of
  accuracy was achieved using the standard PISO algorithm with the
  Crank-Nicolson time derivative. Recommendations for future work are
  discussed.},

  methodologies in order to compute the flow in industrial fans. The
  full resolution of turbulence spectrum in such high-Reynolds number
  flow configurations entails unreasonably expensive computational
  costs. The authors applied the study to a large unidirectional axial
  flow fan unit for tunnel ventilation to operate in the forward direction
  under ambient conditions. This delivered cooling air to the tunnel
  under routine operation, or hot gases at 400∫C under emergency conditions
  in the event of a tunnel fire. The simulations were carried out using
  the open source code OpenFOAM, within which they implemented a very
  large eddy simulation (VLES) based on one-equation SGS model to solve
  a transport equation for the modelled (subgrid) turbulent kinetic
  energy. This subgrid turbulence model improvement is a remedial strategy
  in VLES of high-Reynolds number industrial flows which are able to
  tackle the turbulence spectrum's well-known insufficient resolution.
  The VLES of the industrial fan permits detecting the unsteady topology
  of the rotor flow. This paper explores the evolution of secondary
  flow phenomena and speculates on its influence on the actual load
  capability when operating at peak-pressure condition. Predicted noise
  emissions, in terms of sound pressure level spectra, are also compared

  improve stability of centrifugal compressors. It is widely used in
  turbochargers and other applications where compressors with wide
  flow range are required. This paper reviews the evelopment of the
  ported shroud concept from its first conception in the 1980s to its
  current various configurations, explores the underline mechanisms
  that deliver the performance improvement. It is explained that by
  removing stagnant fluid from impeller inducer shroud end wall boundary-layer
  region and recirculating it to the impeller inlet, blade loading
  near the inducer shroud is increased with improved inlet suction.
  For transonic flow, ported shroud weakens the shock wave and reduces
  flow separation on the inducer suction surface. It is argued that
  the effectiveness of the ported shroud is a balance of blade loading
  and the flow loss inside the ported shroud cavity. The loss needs
  to be minimised if ported shroud is to be more effective. Blade loading
  may be increased by various methods such as using high inducer blade
  turning and using full bladed impellers. The blade loading can also
  be improved by removing flow swirl in ported shroud flow by vanes,
  or imposing negative swirl by vanes in ported shroud. Circumferential
  flow variation caused by volute housing can be taken into account
  by variable pitch vanes or by variable port position.},

  review = {Chen and Lei \cite{chen2012casing} reviewed the progress of ported
  shrouds for centrifugal compressors. Regarding the slot position,
  the closer the port to the LE, the more effective the ported shroud
  is in improving surge margin and compressor efficiency near surge.
  Three of four cavity supporting ribs are generally used, but they
  may cause high cycle fatigue of the impeller inducer blade. To overcome
  this problem, either ribs are placed asimetrically or an external
  duct is used to connect the inducer to the inlet. 
  
  
  Vanes can be placed in the ported shroud so that the recirculating
  flow presents negative swirl, which is found to improve compressor
  stability. The pressure loss in the cavity port should be by the
  increase of blade loading associated to the recirculating flow at
  the inducer tip. Therefore, the bleed slot can be designed using
  vanes to minimize flow losses and thus improve the efficiency and
  stability of the compressor.
  
  
  The use of fully bladed wheels increase the effectiveness of ported
  shrouds and minimize the noise issue associated with this technology.
  The axial distance between impeller LE and port front can be set
  as a function of the azimuth angle to create asymmetric ported shrouds.
  If optimized, these asymmetric ported shrouds present smaller surge
  flow rates thant their symmetric counterparts.},

  is reduced. An elliptical trailing edge increases compressor efficiency
  over a blunt edge, but also makes the compressor less stable at low
  flows and high speeds. Finally, a compressor whose shroud presents
  a tighter corner is more stable at higher speeds but less efficient.

  were obtained with high frequency Kulite transducers mounted on the
  casing upstream and downstream of the fan. The casing pressure variation
  was clearly visible in the measurements when a stall cell passed
  below the transducers. Numerical stall simulations were conducted
  using an implicit, time-accurate, 3D compressible Reynolds-averaged
  Navier-Stokes (RANS) solver. The comparisons between the experiment
  and simulation mainly cover performance curves and time-domain pressure
  traces of Kulites during rotating stall. At two different fan speeds,
  the stall characteristics such as the number and rotating speed of
  the stall cells were well-matched to the experimental values. The
  mass flow rate and the loading parameter under the fully-developed
  rotating stall also showed good agreement with the experiment. In
  both the numerical and experimental results, a large stall cell was
  eventually formed after stall inception regardless of the fan speed.
  Based on the validation, the detailed flow has been evaluated to
  understand rotating stall in a transonic fan. In addition, it was
  found that the mass flow measurement using casing static pressure
  might be wrong during transient flow if the Kulites were mounted

  generally underpredicted the mass flow and efficiency loss through

  the differences were reduced as the frequency increased. Out-of-phase
  pulsations produced
  
  unsteady operating orbits that corresponded to a significant steady-state,

  admission loss, and this was reflected as a drop in the quasi-steady
  efficiency. However,
  
  these differences between quasi-steady in-phase and out-of-phase predictions
  were not
  
  replicated in the measured results, suggesting that the unequal admission
  loss is not as
  
  significant in pulsating flow as it is in steady flow. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4000580]},

  abstract = {Tip clearance between the blade tip and casing of a centrifugal compressor
  can be varied through two methods: by changing the blade height (M1)
  or by changing the casing diameter (M2). In the present study, detailed
  numerical simulations were carried out to compare these two methods
  and their effect on the stage and impeller performance. The impeller
  and diffuser were connected through rotor stator boundary using frozen
  rotor approach. Overall stage performance and the flow configuration
  have been investigated for nine tip clearance levels from no gap
  to 1mm. Impeller and diffuser performances are also presented separately.
  It has been found that the overall and impeller performance were
  comparatively better for M1 below tip clearance of 0.5 mm whereas
  M2 was found advantageous above 0.5 mm of tip clearance. Both the
  methods showed performance degradation with the increase in tip clearance.
  Two models have been proposed for the stage total pressure ratio
  and efficiency, which are found to be in agreement with experimental
  results. The impeller efficiency and the pressure ratio were found
  to be maximum at tip clearance of 0.1 mm for both the cases however
  minimum diffuser effectiveness was also observed at the same clearance
  level. Diffuser effectiveness was found to be maximum at zero gap
  for both cases. As it is practically impossible to have zero gap
  for unshrouded impellers so it is concluded that the optimum thickness
  is 0.5 mm onwards for M1 and 0.5 mm for M2 in terms of diffuser effectiveness.
  Mass averaged flow parameters, entropy, blade loading diagram and
  relative pressure fields are presented, showing the loss production

  a well-defined plenum (large volume) and the other with minimized
  (small) volume of compressed air. The present study measured time-resolved
  oscillations of in-duct and external pressure, along with rotational
  speed. An orifice flow meter was incorporated to obtain time-averaged

  temperature fluctuations in the compressor inlet and exit ducts along
  with a location near the inducer tips. At low flow rates, both the
  large and small volume systems exhibited mild surge as the slope
  of the compressor characteristics became positive, but the small
  volume configuration impeded the growth of instabilities and was
  able to operate without deep surge at mass flow rates well below
  that of the large volume system. The fundamental mild surge frequency
  is shown to be dominated by the geometry of the upstream and downstream
  ducting along with that of the compressor, with in-duct pressure
  measurements revealing frequencies well below 100 Hz for the configurations

  the engines were operating at or near full-load and at low- to mid-engine
  speeds, which places the corresponding compressor operating regime
  in the vicinity of the surge line or near the peak compressor pressure
  ratio for the given operating speed.
  
  
  Data has previously been collected from turbochargers installed on
  engines, limiting the ability to study this phenomenon in isolation.
  The present work provides detailed acoustic and performance measurements
  from a modern compressor on a steady-flow turbocharger bench, with
  the goal of defining the operating regimes associated with elevated
  narrow and broadband noises and the corresponding frequency ranges.
  
  
  The turbocharger test bench at The Ohio State University (uhlenhake2011development)
  is located in a hemi-anechoic room. The facility has "warm flow"
  capability by delivering up to 15 kW of electric heat to the flow

  The turbocharger studied is from the right-bank of the Ford 3.5 L
  TiVCT GTDI EcoBoost engine and is manufactured by BorgWarner. 
  
  
  The compression system employed in the study incorporates a well-defined
  plenum, which is connected to the compressor exit duct and an additional
  duct containing a control valve (Figure 2) This system was studied
  at 1/8 (1.155 L) of the full plenum volume. In addition to the plenum,
  compressed air occupies the volume between the diffuser inlet of
  the compressor and the plenum inlet along with that between the plenum
  exit and the control valve, with a total compressed volume of 2.71
  L.
  
  
  Mild surge is detected on the positively sloped portion of the characteristics,
  and the compression system enters deep surge at flow rates just below
  those on the "Deep Surge Line".
  
  
  Compressor operating Points 1 and 2 are located on the Ncor=107 krpm

  The sound at Point 1 is dominated by the BPF, with a corresponding
  SPL of 122.4 dB. As the compressor operation moves along the Ncor=107
  krpm speed line from Point 1 to 2 in Figure 3, SPL at BPF decreases
  by 14.7 dB to 107.7 dB. 
  
  Moving from Point 1 to 2, on the other hand, elevates the broadband
  noise, which becomes dominant in this region of the compressor map.
  
  
  Incidence angle for the inducer. Axial velocity is calculated from
  the compressor mass flow rate, inlet air density, and inlet duct
  diameter. The incoming flow at the compressor inlet is assumed to
  be purely in the axial direction and the flow field is uniform at
  the impeller eye. Since the largest incidence angle occurs at the
  inducer blade tip, this location is chosen for the analysis. IMHO:
  The flow field at the compressor inlet is anything but uniform near
  surge; even in the tip the flow is reversed!
  
  
  Spectrograms are shown in order to illustrate the frequency content
  in the 0-12 kHz range from choke (low i) on the right to the largest
  amplitude mild surge point (high i) on the left. IMHO: They have
  a sort of aliasing at i=21∫, even thoug Figure 3 shows that they
  took plenty of measurements for each iso-speed line.
  
  
  For the present compressor, Figure 9 indicates that the contribution
  of sound at the BPF dominates the total sound radiated from the compressor
  inlet duct over the operating range where the slopes of the constant
  speed lines are highly negative. 
  
  
  The present compressor exhibited broadband elevation of SPL in the
  4-12 kHz band while operating in the mid-flow region. As i was decreased
  near 21∞, a sharp drop of SPL4k-12k and increase of time-averaged
  temperature near the inducer blade tips occurred simultaneously.
  This behavior reveals that the level of broadband sound radiating
  upstream of the impeller decreased when flow reversal was detected
  upstream of the inducer blade tips. IMHO: We should reproduce the
  same spectrograms with our data. However, care must be paid to the
  frequency limits (e.g., 4 and 12 kHz), since for all speeds they
  may not include the same noise sources.
  
  
  Between i=24∞ and the deep surge line, where the elevated noise is
  attributed to discrete, low frequency mild surge instabilities at
  the Helmholtz resonator frequency of the compression system and the
  accompanying broadband elevation in the 100-4000 Hz range (dehner2012instabilities).},

  common in automotive powerplants, monopolizing the diesel sector
  and having a steadily increasing percentage in the gasoline one.
  In this frame, the interest in modeling the behavior of the turbomachinery
  components involved, with the ultimate goal of characterizing the
  performance of the turbocharged ICE, seems clear. A turbomachine
  can be simulated using three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics
  software, but its computational cost does not allow one to reproduce
  the whole turbocharger test rig. Moreover, the existence of long
  ducts requires a considerable computational time until the pressure
  reflections at the boundaries dissipate in order to reach a periodic
  solution. The use of non-reflecting boundary conditions reduces the
  length of ducts needed without introducing spurious wave reflections.
  An anechoic boundary condition (BC) based on the method of characteristics
  (MoC) has been previously developed, considering the case of an inviscid
  and adiabatic one-dimensional flow of a perfect gas. However, real
  flows do not behave in such an ideal manner. In this paper, the extension
  of the scope of the previous BC is sought. In this way, a methodology
  to evaluate the performance of the anechoic BC under these real flow
  situations is shown. The consideration of an ideal gas instead of
  perfect gas, the flow viscosity, and the non-homentropic flow make
  it necessary to modify the method of characteristics, since the Riemann
  invariants are not constant any more. In this frame they are referred
  to as Riemann variables. An additional issue that has been considered
  is the effect of swirl flow, such as the one in the turbine outlet,
  on the anechoic BC. Some improvements to be implemented in the BC
  are proposed in order to have a better performance in these real
  flow situations.},

  intensity is measured by applying the three microphones method and
  the decomposition of the acoustic measurement into an incident and

  The value of acoustic intensity is averaged over the frequency range

  approach is designed to extend the LES region of the original DES
  approach (hybrid RANS/LES) from Spalart et. al. (1997) to the turbulent
  boundary layer, as proposed first by Travin et. al. in 2006. The
  non-zonal blending occures therefore inside the boundary layer -
  the RANS model acts as a wall model for the LES. The actual work
  shows the capabilities of this novel approach for the simulation
  of broadband noise for attached flows. The simulation is compared
  to measurements from the EC Lyon including PIV and LDA data around
  the airfoil and unsteady on-wall pressure measurements near the trailing
  edge. Far field computations are carried out by applying the Ffowcs-Williams
  and Hawkings analogy to the unsteady wall pressure field and compared
  to acoustic measurements as well as to a far field prediction based
  on a trailing edge noise model that is applied to the experimental
  aerodynamic pressure field.},

  inside a turbocharger centrifugal compressor with vaneless diffuser.
  Three-dimensional Reynolds averaged compressible Navier-Stokes equations
  were solved with k-e turbulence model using computational fluid dynamics
  software CFX. Entire geometry of the compressor, including the impeller,
  vaneless diffuser, and volute housing were included in the simulation.
  The stage performance curve was obtained using steady and unsteady
  calculations and compared with experimental results. The unsteady
  flow simulation was performed at reduced mass flowrates (compressor
  stall region) with a plenum chamber model added at the compressor
  housing outlet. The results show that there is a distinct stall frequency
  at the given compressor speed. The amplitude (and the rotating speed)
  of the static pressure oscillation at this frequency in the diffuser
  is increased with reduction in compressor mass flow. The stall frequency
  is only marginally affected by the compressor mass flowrate. Time
  varying flow fields in the diffuser and in the volute indicate that
  there is a circumferential standing wave inside the volute. It is
  proposed that the volute behaves like a tuned pipe resonator and
  this dictates the stall frequency. The stall is also characterized
  by a periodically reversing flow at the centre of the volute discharge
  cross-section.},

  For rotor and diffuser flow passages, structured mesh was used. The
  O-type mesh is employed near the rotor blades, and mean y+ value
  was about 20. The H-type mesh was adopted in the other parts of passages.
  An independent H-type mesh was used in the rotor tip clearance. The
  minimun mesh angle is 15'59∫, and the total number of the mesh cells
  is over 1'6 millions. For the volute, an unstructured tetrahedral
  mesh was generated with refinement around the tongue region. A structured
  mesh was employed at the volute exit. The total number of the volute
  mesh cells is over 800.000. (Total number of the compressor mesh
  cells is over 2'4 million; our mesh, taking into account only rotor
  and difusser flow passages and volute, has 0,2 million cells)
  
  
  During the unsteady simulation, the transient rotor/stator interface
  was adopted between wheel outlet and vaneless diffuser inlet. (I
  assume is sort of CFX specific terms, since he quotes the CFX manual,
  but I don't know what it means) The physical time step was set to
  1'13e-5 s(while ours is 4.28572e-06 s. NOTE: assuming they have same
  velocities as ours (their rotational speed is 44 krpm, while ours
  is 140 krpm), if they have more mesh cells (øless cell size?:compare
  geometries) and a time step three times bigger tan ours, what is
  their Courant number???).
  
  
  Near the solid walls, the scalable wall function was used (same as
  above). The inlet boundary conditions were steady, and consisted
  of spatially uniform total pressure and total temperature. Surface
  roughness of the compressor housing was included in the simulation
  (ø?). Mass flowrate was imposed at the outlet boundary (only during
  steady simulation, isn't it?). 
  
  
  They use a plenum at the outlet as we do. However, they speak about
  a plenum's constant (page 685) that is not clear enough for me.},

  industry such as aircraft, home appliances, and vehicles. Comfort
  and quietness are important in these uses. As a result, noise has
  become an important consideration in compressor design besides the
  conventional performance parameters such as efficiency and pressure
  ratio. However, compressor noise has been difficult to understand
  because of the lack of information. The aim of this paper is to investigate
  the aero-acoustic characteristics of a centrifugal compressor for
  the fuelcell vehicle by experiments. The existing compressor system
  is modified to measure the internal pressure fluctuation at the impeller
  inlet, the impeller outlet and the diffuser outlet. Four microphone
  probes are also installed to determine the external noise levels
  and spectra of the compressor in an airtight room according to the
  RPM and mass flow rate. The test results show the possibility to
  tell the relative noise level of a centrifugal compressor with the
  internal pressure data. The external microphone signals have relation
  to the internal pressure signals. They have similar patterns and
  spectra. It is a noteworthy phenomenon because it is easier and inexpensive
  to predict pressure behaviors than noise characteristics of centrifugal
  compressors. The dominant noise source is the tonal noise during
  normal operation. But the broadband noise component due to the turbulent
  flow in the compressor increases during low flow rate operation.
  Computational simulations are carried out to describe these phenomena

  SPL of impeller inlet transducer presented a sudden increase when
  moving from BEP to stall conditions, due to onset of flow dettachments
  and backflows. Impeller and diffuser outlet spectra are alike: they
  show a broadband increas in 2-4 kHz frequency range when reducing
  mass flow from BEP. At stall conditions, a tone appears at 90/% of
  rotation order, and is attributted to rotating stall by the authors.
  
  
  Oriffice noise measured with external microphones is consistent with
  compressor inner probes spectra: amplitude in low frequency range
  is increased as mass flow is reduced.

  simulations are carried out to describe these phenomena and to identify
  noise indicators. The turbulence kinetic energy and the pressure
  distribution obtained from CFD results may be indicative of the relative
  noise intensity of the compressor. 
  
  
  The impeller was driven by a DC motor directly.
  
  
  The compressor was examined by numerical analysis using the commercial
  CFD code, CFX 11 together with the k-e turbulence model. ANSYS Turbogrid
  was used to generate the grid. An impeller passage
  
  with a main blade and a splitter blade and one passage for the vaneless
  diffuser were simulated as the computational domains. The periodic
  boundary condition was applied at the sides. The total number of
  elements was about 450 k including the inlet and outlet blocks. In
  the numerical simulations, the flow was assumed to be at a steady
  state with reference to the relative frame.
  
  
  If the compressor operate at the design point only, so the noise source
  acted like monopole, we could expect and evaluate the relative noise
  strength of the compressor with pressure data from a simple steady
  simulation.
  
  
  The spectra of II and III look the same. The blade passing frequency
  (12,000 Hz) and its harmonics are dominant. And the difference is
  shown only in the low frequency section (1.5 to 6 kHz). But the spectra
  of the operating point I is quite different from the other spectra.
  The noise levels increase in all ranges. So, the noise can be considered
  as broadband noise without prominent discrete tones. This is a property
  of broadband noise caused by turbulent flows.
  
  
  A separation and backflows present in the impeller inlet as indicated
  by Fig. 12(a). But the separation and backflows are diminished at
  the best efficiency point (c)
  
  
  The dominant frequency is about 91.5% of the fn, 610 Hz. It is almost
  certain that this is the rotating stall frequency. The rotating stall
  has a speed in the range of 10 to 30% of fn in general. But a high
  frequency rotating stall was reported by K‰mmer [18]. According to
  him, it developed when the stall occurred at the inlet and the outlet
  of the impeller at the same time. He showed that it was generated
  in the impeller by the periodic break down of energy transfer from
  the rotor to the flow. It was a kind of superm positioning of the
  inducer and diffuser stalls and its frequency.
  
  
  The circular pressure distributions are used to calculate the p'rms
  in this study. The distributions were assumed as a rotating perturbation.
  The red triangles indicate p'rms from steady simulations. They have
  about 75-78% values of the experimental data at each point. But they
  are also proportional to the square of the RPM. This is a characteristic
  of a noise source acting like monopole. So, this result confirmed
  p'rms to be a noise indicator which makes the noise problem simple
  at the design point operation. It is almost certain that p'rms can
  tell the relative strength of a noise source at the highest efficiency
  point, to say the least of it.},

  effective operational range for a ported shroud compressor. The size

  at the inlet and outlet of the compressor housing. Detailed numerical
  computations of the flow in the entire compressor section under similar
  operating conditions have also been carried out.The experimental
  work includes Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) measurements of
  the instantaneous and mean velocity field at the inlet. At surge,
  low frequency pulsations are detected that seem to result from back
  flow already observed in stall. The numerical computations include
  details of the flow by having good spatial and temporal resolution
  and using Large Eddy Simulations (LES) to account for the turbulence.
  LES is most suitable for the surge flow since it resolves the large
  scale structures, such as flow separation and reversed flow, which
  characterize surge.},

  second order Finite Volume method, equation discretisation errors
  are represented through numerical diffusion. Numerical diffusion
  coefficients from the discretisation of the convection term and the
  temporal derivative are derived. In an attempt to reduce numerical
  diffusion from the convection term, a new stabilised and bounded
  second-order differencing scheme is proposed. Three new methods of
  error estimation are presented. The Direct Taylor Series Error estimate
  is based on the Taylor series truncation error analysis. It is set
  up to enable single-mesh single-run error estimation. The Moment
  Error estimate derives the solution error from the cell imbalance
  in higher moments of the solution. A suitable normalisation is used
  to estimate the error magnitude. The Residual Error estimate is based
  on the local inconsistency between face interpolation and volume
  integration. Extensions of the method to transient flows and the
  Local Residual Problem error estimate are also given. Finally, an
  automatic error-controlled adaptive mesh refinement algorithm is
  set up in order to automatically produce a solution of pre-determined
  accuracy. It uses mesh refinement and unrefinement to control the
  local error magnitude. The method is tested on several characteristic
  flow situations, ranging from incompressible to supersonic flows,
  for both steady-state and transient problems.},

  abstract = {The advent of Eco-Boost technology in gasoline engines creates new
  challenges that need to be addressed with innovative designs. One
  of them is flow induced noise caused by flow, entering the turbocharger,
  at off design operation. At certain vehicle operation conditions,
  the mass flow rate and pressure ratio are such that compressor wheel
  generates a broad band frequency noise caused by flow separation
  from blade surfaces, which is called "whoosh" noise. 
  
  
  Flow bench and engine testing can be used to detect flow induced noise,
  but understanding the fundamental mechanisms of such noise generation
  is necessary for developing an effective design. This paper describes
  Computational Aero-Acoustic (CAA) analyses performed to study the
  effects of inlet condition on the whoosh noise. A 3D Computational

  the experimental rig pressure signals were recorded at several throttling
  valve positions and subjected to Fourier analysis. The results are
  shown in the form of contour maps with frequency on the horizontal
  and control valve opening on the vertical axis. The maps allow the
  frequencies dominating at consecutive stages of entering surge to
  be distinguished. Moreover, comparison of the maps, obtained at different
  pressure tappings allowed the point of instability onset to be determined.
  Research confirmed that the first disturbances appeared in the inlet
  recirculation zone much before the surge. The scale of the disturbances
  were considerable, amplitude increased about 10 times together with
  an immediate rise of its mean value. On the other hand, flow structure
  was not regular as no dominating frequency was detected. When the
  flow rate continued to decrease the instabilities propagated throughout
  the impeller towards the diffuser and certain frequency peaks appeared
  suggesting the formation of regular flow structures. At deep surge
  spectrum is dominated by one peak that is in good agreement with
  frequency of the corresponding Helmholtz resonator. Moreover, due
  to the high accuracy of the 'quasi-dynamic' method it was possible

  radial compressor aeroacoustics. It concentrates mainly on automotive
  turbocharger operations in the low mass-flow range where blade leading-edge
  and tip separation reduce the compressor performance and induce transient
  flow behaviour. Whereas the blade-passing is tonal and at high frequency,
  usually beyond the human hearing range, transience in the flow are
  turbulence-dominated, broad-band in nature, and in magnitude a significant
  source of aeroacoustics which appears well within the range of peak
  human hearing (1-5kHz). Other noise sources occur due to distortions
  in the flow upstream of the compressor face, and rotating stall.
  
  
  The simulation methodology enumerated here pays attention to all the
  above flow-induced aeroacoustics. Due consideration is given to turbulence
  modelling, to ensure that both the narrow-band and broad-band sources
  are directly resolved in the CFD. Appropriate discretisation practices
  are adopted, so as to capture both turbulent-convection and sound-propagation
  mechanisms. Pressure-wave non-reflective boundary conditions are
  applied to the computational boundaries to remove any artificial
  resonances in the domain.

  volume = {24},
  pages = {793--813},
  number = {8},
  abstract = {Purpose ? This paper aims to accelerate the iteration convergence
  for elliptic fluid flow problems, so that an under-relaxation factor
  control method is developed.
  
  
  Design/methodology/approach ? There should be an optimal under-relaxation
  factor that can result in the equivalence of the global residual
  norms of momentum equation u and momentum equation v. The two residual
  norms of the momentum equations will be equivalent through controlling
  the velocity under-relaxation factors, and then the iteration convergence
  can be accelerated. Two expressions are proposed to adjust the values
  of under-relaxation factors for every n iterations.
  
  
  Findings ? From the five preliminary computations it is found that
  the value of g can be larger than 1 and of n can be less than 5 for
  an open system, and the value of g should be less than 1 and that
  of n should be larger than 10 for a closed system. These two pairs
  of parameters are then used in another five examples. It is found
  that the saving in CPU times is at least 43.9 percent for the closed
  system and 67.5 percent for the open system.
  
  
  Research limitations/implications ? When the Re or Ra of the two-dimensional
  problems are low, this control method is feasible. More research
  work is needed in order to apply it in three-dimensional or high
  Re or Ra problems.
  
  
  Originality/value ? This method is helpful for the acceleration of
  iteration convergence in simple problems, and is a preparation for
  the advanced research in complicated problems.},

  year = {2007},

  abstract = {In the last decade fluid dynamic simulation tools have encountered
  an increased demand to assist the design phase. As a matter of fact,
  the aid of CFD tools can remarkably reduce the duration and the costs
  of this stage. However, the numerical simulation, if not correctly
  handled, can produce the opposite effect. For instance, a fully multidimensional
  analysis of a multi cylinder engine coupled to its own intake and
  exhaust system might become a challenge even using a PC cluster.
  A factor that has to be considered is the possibility of relying
  on simpler and lighter calculation tools.
  
  Large systems, in fact, are often analyzed using one dimensional simulation
  tools to save time and simultaneously conserve computational resources.
  Certain components, however, such as the intake and exhaust manifolds,
  exhibit an high degree of geometric complexity which can not be accurately
  modeled by 1D codes. Those models suffer mainly from the limitation
  of the plane wave assumption, which is not appropriate for the simulation
  of complex shape components (air boxes, resonators, asymmetric expansion
  chambers, multi-pipe junctions, etc.), characterized by a significant
  non-planar wave motion. Therefore, the application of multiD codes
  might be exploited to model only complex parts of an intake or exhaust
  system whereas the 1D approach is applied elsewhere, suitably coupling
  the two models at their interfaces, balancing the requirements of
  short runtime and result accuracy.
  
  To combine the benefits of the two approaches, an integration of the
  two models was realized, coupling a 1D code with a CFD code. The
  HLLC Godunov type Riemann solver has been implemented both in the
  CFD and the 1D codes to solve the Euler system of equations, in order
  to limit eventual instabilities which might be generated when using
  different numerical schemes. Moreover, the HLLC solver has been applied
  to treat the boundary conditions at the interface between the two
  domains, in such a way to allow the propagation of flow non uniformities
  through the domain interface, without affecting the solution accuracy.
  Hence, during the simulation the informations are continually passed
  back and forth between the two codes, resulting in a complete integration
  time step by time step. Numerous tests, involving the shock tube
  case, have been carried out to prove the stability and accuracy of
  the integrated code.
  
  The validation was carried out on two different cases. The first case
  consisted in the simulation of a V10 Lamborghini engine in which
  the 5 into 1 junction (Figure 1) has been modeled by the multidimensional
  approach. The measured pressure pulses downstream of one cylinder
  have been compared to the calculated ones showing an interesting
  agreement (Figure 2). The improved resolution of the wave motion
  by means of the integrated code has allowed also a better estimation
  of the engine volumetric efficiency. The second case was the optimization
  of a Formula SAE single cylinder engine, in which an Helmholtz resonator
  was inserted in the intake system, downstream of a Venturi tube (Figure
  4), to improve the performance at high engine revolution speeds.
  In this presentation it will be shown the development of the 1D-3D
  coupling and its application to the following cases:
  
  Simulation of a 5 into 1 junction of a V10 Lamborghini Engine ;
  
  Simulation of a Helmholtz resonator for the improvement of the engine
  volumetric efficiency;
  
  Simulation of a motorbike air box system;
  
  Non linear acoustic analysis of silencing devices (Figure 5).},

  Inviscid flow --> some conclussions could be wrong
  
  Experimental data:
  
  the distributions of mean velocities and Reynolds stresses at 8 measurement
  sections are available
  
  included in the ERCOFTAC database (Test case 72: Turbulent Pipe Flow
  with Swirl)

  wall jet (S0=0.18)
  
  concentrated vortex (S0=0.18)
  
  solid body (S0=0.05)
  
  All measurement series were performed for Reynolds number (based on
  the diameter and on the bulk velocity U = 4.3 [m/s] and water cinematic
  viscosity) 50.000 and 300.000.
  
  The data were obtained with a a 2-component laser-Doppler system.
  
  Concentrated vortex (Re=300k) data is used to assess the accuracy
  of numerical results.
  
  Numerical investigations
  
  Inlet BC
  
  Rankine vortex is a good analytical starting point to this swirling
  flow
  
   A better approximation is the Bachelor vortex.
  
  However, I guess that experimental data is eventually fitted with
  q vortex model
  
  Interpolation schemes
  
  Only the velocity second order interpolation scheme predicts correct
  the velocity field in swirling flow
  
  However, in centre of the computational domain a significant discrepancy
  between inviscid numerical result and (turbulent) experimental data
  is obtained.
  
  PRESTO pressure interpolation scheme predict better the experimental
  data in the viscous core region 
  
  Since they are computing inviscid flow, the behavior with turbulent
  flow could be not the same...
  
  Mesh (Not well explained...)
  
  Cross section
  
  Square-to-circle approach with several levels of refinement at the
  core.
  
  Intermediate refinement level is chosen due to sufficient accuracy
  (without taking into account the vortex core (inviscid)) 
  
  Longitudinal mesh
  
  ?x/D=1 is chosen (WTF!!)
  
  Outlet BC
  
  Constant p performs quite bad unless L/D=30 is chosen.
  
  Outflow BC performs better regardless of the outlet position
  
  Dangerous with strong swirling flows ? backflow ? outflow BC not suitable.
  
   Radial equilibrium
  
  Good agreement
  
  Axial velocity really well captured when placing outlet at L/D=30
  (even at the core!!)
  
  But tangential velocity bad captured if outlet is at L/D=30 !!
  
  Maybe due to inviscid computation??
  
  p-v coupling
  
  PISO predicts better axial velocity at the vortex core.
  
  However, they don't tell anything about number of inner and outer
  loops, computational effort, ?
  
  Results
  
  Euler model performs better with higher Re number (as expected)},

  fields from flow velocity field data, typically obtained with particle
  image velocimetry (PIV), by combining the experimental data with
  the governing equations. Although the basic working principles on
  which this procedure relies have been known for quite some time,
  the recent expansion of PIV capabilities has greatly increased its
  practical potential, up to the extent that nowadays a time-resolved
  volumetric pressure determination has become feasible. This has led
  to a novel diagnostic methodology for determining the instantaneous
  flow field pressure in a non-intrusive way, which is rapidly finding
  acceptance in an increasing variety of application areas. The current
  review describes the operating principles, illustrating how the flow-governing
  equations, in particular the equation of momentum, are employed to
  compute the pressure from the material acceleration of the flow.
  Accuracy aspects are discussed in relation to the most dominating
  experimental influences, notably the accuracy of the velocity source
  data, the temporal and spatial resolution and the method invoked
  to estimate the material derivative. In view of its nature of an
  emerging technique, recently published dedicated validation studies
  will be given specific attention. Different application areas are
  addressed, including turbulent flows, aeroacoustics, unsteady wing
  aerodynamics and other aeronautical applications.},

  1.- INTRODUCTION
  
  
  OpenFOAM (CFD FVM, accepts polyhedra, moving mesh, conjugate heat
  transfer)
  
  Case studied (ERCOFTAC Centrifugal Pump)
  
  
  
  2 METHOD
  
  
  The incompressible RANS eqs, using FVM and a standard k-e turbulence
  model closure with wall-functions. The convection discretization
  uses a second-order linearUpwind scheme. Two different rotor-stator
  approaches are used:
  
  
  - Frozen rotor AKA MRF (steady, fixed mesh)
  
  - Sliding grid (transient, rotor/estator interaction considered, requires
  a sliding grid interface)
  
  
  OpenFOAM sliding grid interface (section 4):
  
  
  - GGI (General Grid Interface)
  
  - Topology changes
  
  
  
  3 THE ERCOFTAC CENTRIFUGAL PUMP CASE-STUDY
  
  
  Is a simplified model of a centrifugal turbomachine. The purpose was
  to study the flow unsteadiness generated by rotor-stator interaction
  in a turbomachine.
  
  
  3.1 Geometry
  
  
  7 impeller blades, 12 diffuser vanes and 6% vaneless radial gap. The
  test rig was built by M.Ubaldi et al. 
  
  
  ¬ø? ¬øPor qu√© lo llaman pump y usan eqs. incompresibles si trabajan

  3.2 Measurements
  
  
  The experimental data was provided by Ubaldi et al. Open circuit with
  air directly discharged into the atmosphere from the radial diffuser.
  
  
  Phase locked ensemble averaged velocity components have been measured
  with hot wire probes at the impeller outlet. The data includes the
  distribution of the ensemble averaged static pressure at the impeller
  front end, taken by means of miniature fast response transducers
  mounted at the stationary casing of the impeller. LDV measurements
  were also performed in the impeller and in the diffuser. The measurements
  made by Ubaldi were made using a hot-wire probe at a radial distance
  4 mm from the blade trailing edge.
  
  
  3.3 Case-study set-up and cases
  
  
  It can be found in the turbomachinery Special Interest Group web page
  at the OpenFOAM Wiki (http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Sig_Turbomachinery).
  It includes block- structured meshes, scripts that automatically
  set up the cases, and automatic post-processing of the results and
  comparison with the measurements.
  
  
  A 2D representation of the geometry is used. The 2D mesh was made
  using ICEM-HEXA. 94 000 cells, with an average Y+ value of 35.
  
  
  ¬∑ Steady state frozen rotor cases, using MRF (Multiple Reference
  Frames)
  
   - ECPGgi2D: The frozen rotor approach, and the GGI between the impeller
  and the diffuser.
  
   - ECPStitchMesh2D: The frozen rotor approach, where the rotor and
  stator meshes have been stitched together at the interface, forming
  a single mesh with hanging nodes at the interface.
  
  ¬∑ Unsteady sliding grid cases
  
   - ECPMixerGgiFvMesh2D: The sliding grid approach, where the GGI is
  applied between the impeller and the diffuser at each time step.
  
   - ECPMixerFvMesh2D: The sliding grid approach, where the rotor and
  stator meshes are stitched together at the interface at each time
  step, forming a single mesh with hanging nodes at the interface at
  each time step.
  
  
  ¬ø? No entiendo la diferencia entre GGi y stitch.
  
  
  3.4 Results
  
  3.4.1 Steady-state simulation - frozen rotor
  
  The computed velocities show some similarity with the experimental
  data . However, the results do not agree perfectly with the experimental
  ones (MRF)
  
  
  The GGI and the stitched cases give exactly the same results, and
  it can thus be concluded that the interface coupling works as it
  should.
  
  ¬ø? ¬øEn GGI interpolas y en el otro unes las 2 mallas?
  
  
  3.4.2 Unsteady simulation, using the sliding grid approach
  
  
  Both computations (ECPMixerGgiFvMesh2D and ECPMixerFvMesh2D) give
  the same results.
  
  
  With the unsteady simulation, the wakes are more visible, and they
  are advected properly between the diffuser blades. There is a better,
  although not perfect, agreement between the simulations and the experimental
  data, compare to the frozen rotor simulation
  
  
  4 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
  
  4.1 Steady-state solver for Multiple Reference Frames
  
  
  In the MRF approach, the momentum equations uses a mix of inertial
  and relative velocities, and only one extra term appears in the equations.
  
  
  4.1.1 Frozen rotor
  
  
  The rotating and stationary parts are considered to be at a fixed
  position relative to each other. A connection must be made between
  these meshes (GGI or topologycal changes)
  
  
  4.1.2 Mixing plane
  
  
  At the interface the flow properties are circumferentially averaged.
  This removes all transient rotor-stator interactions, but it still
  gives fairly representative results. A mixing-plane simulation only
  requires one rotor blade and one stator blade per stage, which significantly
  accelerates the solution procedure.
  
  The mixing plane is under implementation in OpenFOAM at the moment.
  
  
  4.2 Unsteady solver for sliding grid
  
  
  PISO algorithm for pressure-velocity coupling. The solver also uses
  libraries for mesh motion and deformation of polyhedral meshes [7],
  of which one of them handles partly rotating meshes. The coupling
  between the rotating and non-rotating parts of the mesh can be accomplished
  by either topological changes or GGI.
  
  
  4.3 Topological changes
  
  
  Every time-step, the non-conformal connection is resolved by using
  hanging nodes. Then, the hanging nodes are erased and it all starts
  again. 
  
  This operation can be quite time-consuming, as it needs to re-organize
  the topology and the internal numbering of faces and cells at each
  time step. However, the method is fully conservative.
  
  
  4.4 General Grid Interface (GGI)
  
  
  The GGI can be used to speed up the operation of the coupling between
  the rotor and stator domains. The basic GGI is using weighted interpolation
  to evaluate and transmit flow values across a pair of conformal or
  non-conformal coupled patches. The GGI weighting factors are basically
  the percentage of surface intersection between two overlapping faces.
  
  The GGI implementation is using the Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm to
  compute the master and shadow face intersection surface area
  
  
  5 Conclusions
  
  Both steady state simulations using Multiple Reference Frames and
  unsteady simulations using a transient solver with sliding mesh were
  performed. Good agreements were found with the experiments, but improvements
  can be made.
  
  
  The same simulations will be performed in 3D, and alternative boundary
  conditions will be investigated. The coming mixing plane implementation
  will also be evaluated in the same case.},

  review = {Raitor and Neise \cite{raitor2008sound} conducted an experimental
  study to describe the sound generation mechanisms of centrifugal
  compressors. 
  
  
  Aero-engines operating with supersonic fan tip speeds are known to
  generate a tonal sound spectrum spread over a range of harmonics
  of the engine shaft rotation frequency. These harmonics are commonly
  termed "buzz-saw" tones. The pressure signature attached to a supersonic
  ducted fan will be a saw tooth waveform. These rotor-speed harmonics
  are caused by the shock waves in the rotating blade channels.
  
  
  At the low rotor speeds 30,000-34,000/min, narrow-band noise components
  are observed at about half the BPF, which increase with speed. At
  30,000 and 32,000/min, the levels of the narrow-band components are
  higher than the BPF level and therefore dominate the overall noise
  of the compressor. The narrow-band components are produced by the
  secondary flow through the gap between the compressor casing and
  the impeller blade tips, similar to the "tip clearance noise" (TCN).
  TCN has the highest levels at low speeds and is somewhat diminished
  by the presence of the vaned diffuser.
  
  
  The spectral content of the sound spectra changes when propagating
  upstream from the rotor inlet plane into the immediate inlet duct
  and further into the inlet duct which is due to the sound transmission
  and reflection characteristics of the ducts and the bellmouth nozzle
  and by nonlinear damping effects which particularly affect low-frequency
  components composed from evanescent acoustic duct modes. Each rotor-speed
  harmonic i of buzz-saw noise is formed by only one azimuthal mode
  with its mode order being equal to the rotor-speed harmonic order:
  m = i (see e.g., McAlpine et al. [16]). In the case considered in
  Fig. 7, the modes m=1-4 are not propagational in the immediate inlet
  duct at their respective frequencies and are therefore substantially
  reduced in level.
  
  
  At nred = 50,000 and 42,000/min, the overall sound pressure level
  is dominated by the BPF component while at nred =36,000 and 30,000/min
  a narrow-band component at about half the BPF exhibits maximum levels.
  
  
  In the outlet duct, rotor-speed harmonics are found only below the
  BPF with levels substantially lower than on the inlet side. Obviously,
  shock fronts attached to the rotor blades radiate sound efficiently
  in the upstream but not in the downstream direction. At nred º 42,000/min,
  the tonal noise components in the outlet duct are higher in level
  than on the inlet side. This clearly demonstrates that the rotor-stator
  interaction is important for the noise radiation into the outlet
  duct but not for the inlet side. Beginning at 13 kHz, the random
  noise levels on the outlet side decrease more strongly with frequency
  than on the inlet side.
  
  
  For rotor speeds of 30,000 and 36,000/min., the BPF component dominates
  the overall noise level when the outlet guide vanes are in place,
  but not so with the vaneless diffuser. TCN is clearly visible below
  and above the BPF with the vaneless diffuser and much less distinct
  with outlet guide vanes.
  
  
  The total sound power level LW increases with the rotor speed up to
  nred = 36,000/min where a relative maximum is reached. Above 36,000/min
  there is a slight decrease of LW,tot and a subsequent rise beginning
  at 44,000/min. In the speed range up to 36,000/min, TCN is the strongest
  spectral component and dominates the overall noise level. At higher
  speeds, TCN becomes weaker, and the blade tone levels grow. A noticeable
  noise level increase does not occur until rotor speeds between 44,000
  and 46,000/min. The reason for this behaviour is that the BPF component
  is dominated by a single azimuthal duct mode m = 13 which is cut
  off below 45,000/min and contributes to the far-field sound level
  only above this rotor speed. The exact reason for the speed dependence
  of the TCN is not known. Radial tip clearance gap variation with
  rotor speed due to blade deflections under centrifugal and/or thermalstresses
  and/or due to the speed characteristics of the rotor shaft bearing
  system and aerodynamics of the blade tip flow were the suggested
  mechanisms.
  
  
  When the outlet guide vanes are added, the mode spectra on the compressor
  inlet side are dominated by rotor-alone noise tones. Disturbances
  due to rotor-stator interaction certainly exist downstream of the
  rotor, but they cannot propagate through the transonic flow regimes
  in the rotating blade channels into the inlet duct.
  
  
  At the rotor speed nred =42,000/min (no spectrum shown here), the
  BPF component is fBPF = 9147 Hz. In the immediate inlet duct, the
  mode m =13 lies just outside the range of propagational modes at
  this frequency and, therefore, has a much lower level than the modes
  of lower order which are inside the range of cut-on modes. Since
  the cut-off mode m = 13 cannot propagate through the immediate inlet
  duct, it is also unimportant in the larger inlet duct although it
  falls in the range of cut-on modes there. The above discussion helps
  to explain the dependence of the sound pressure and sound power level
  on the rotor speed depicted in Fig. 11. Despite the onset of transonic
  flow, the overall levels diminish at nred =41,000/min because the
  mode m = 13 is cut off. The subsequent increase at nred = 45,000/min
  is due to the mode m = 13 at BPF cutting on which makes the BPF the
  dominant spectral component in the inlet duct.
  
  
  
  
  
  At the design speed with supersonic flow conditions in the rotor blade
  channels, blade tone noise and buzz-saw noise are the main contributors.
  On the inlet, rotor-alone noise is the main source while rotor-stator
  interaction noise dominates on the outlet side in case of vaned outlet
  diffusers. Over a large
  
  range of rotor speeds with subsonic flow conditions, radial compressor
  noise is dominated by tip clearance noise which is produced by the
  secondary flow through the gap between rotor blade tips and the casing
  wall which in turn gives rise to the rotating instability phenomena.},

  abstract = {This report intends to shed an insight into the effect of large relative
  tip clearances on the onset of instability in a highly loaded centrifugal
  compressor. Time-resolved pressure measurements have been performed
  along the casing of a scaled-up model of a small compressor for two
  clearances at a wide range of operating conditions. Based on these
  time-resolved measurements, the pressure distribution along the meridional
  length and the blade loading distribution are calculated for each
  operating condition. In addition, the phase locked pressure fluctuation
  and its deviation are computed. The results show the behavior of
  each subcomponent of the compressor at different flow conditions
  and explain the role of the relative tip clearance on the onset of
  instability. For high mass-flow rates, the steady pressure distribution
  along the casing reveals that the inducer acts as an accelerating
  nozzle. Pressure is only built up in the radial part due to the centrifugal
  forces and in the subsequent diffuser due to area change. For off-design
  conditions, incidence effects are seen in the blade loading distribution
  at the leading edge while the inducer is unloaded. A region of high
  pressure deviation originates at the leading edge of the main blade
  and convects downstream. This feature is interpreted as the trajectory
  of the leakage vortex. The trajectory of these vortices is strongly
  affected by the mass-flow coefficient. If the mass-flow rate is sufficiently
  small, the trajectory of the leakage vortex becomes perpendicular
  to the axis of rotation, the leakage vortex interacts with the adjacent
  blade, and inlet tip recirculation is triggered. If the flow rate
  is further reduced, the leakage vortex vanishes and rotating stall
  is initiated in the diffuser. For larger clearances, stronger vortices
  are formed, stall is triggered at higher flow rates, and the overall
  compressor performance deteriorates.},

  tip leakage vortex trajectory from the leading edge becomes perpendicular
  
  to the main flow direction and interacts with the leading
  
  edge of the adjacent blade, resulting in flow recirculation at
  
  the blade's leading edge. This leads to pressure fluctuations, and
  if
  
  the mass flow is further decreased, rotating stall is initiated in
  the

  phenomena inside small automotive turbochargers will be analyzed.
  These phenomena will be studied from the point of view of internal
  heat transfer between turbine and compressor and with a one-dimensional
  approach. A series of tests in a gas stand, with steady and pulsating
  hot flow in the turbine side, will be modeled to show the good agreement
  in turbocharger enthalpies prediction. The goodness of the model
  will be also shown predicting turbine and compressor outlet temperatures.
  An accurate prediction of these parameters is a key factor to make

  study is performed with a commercial vehicle diesel engine having

  pulsations from critical points in the air charging system. In order
  to have a better understanding of the phenomena, the operation map
  of the compressor wheel is investigated as well. As a result, high

  abstract = {A study has been conducted, using an unsteady three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged
  Navier-Stokes simulation, to define the effect of impeller-diffuser
  interaction on the performance of a centrifugal compressor stage.
  The principal finding from the study was that the most influential
  aspect of this unsteady interaction was the effect on impeller tip
  leakage flow. In particular, the unsteadiness due to the upstream
  potential effect of the diffuser vanes led to larger viscous losses
  associated with the impeller tip leakage flow. The consequent changes
  at the impeller exit with increasing interaction were identified
  as reduced slip, reduced blockage, and increased loss. The first
  two were beneficial to pressure rise, while the third was detrimental.
  The magnitudes of the effects were examined using different impeller-diffuser
  spacings and it was shown that there was an optimal radial gap size
  for maximum impeller pressure rise. The physical mechanism was also
  determined: When the diffuser was placed closer to the impeller than
  the optimum, increased loss overcame the benefits of reduced slip
  and blockage. The findings provide a rigorous explanation for experimental
  observations made on centrifugal compressors. The success of a simple
  flow model in capturing the pressure rise trend indicated that although
  the changes in loss, blockage, and slip were due largely to unsteadiness,
  the consequent impacts on performance were mainly one-dimensional.
  The influence of flow unsteadiness on diffuser performance was found
  to be less important than the upstream effect, by a factor of seven
  in terms of stage pressure rise in the present geometry. It is thus
  concluded that the beneficial effects of impeller-diffuser interaction
  on overall stage performance come mainly from the reduced blockage
  and reduced slip associated with the unsteady tip leakage flow in
  the impeller.},

  abstract = {A CFD strategy is proposed that combines delayed detached-eddy simulation
  (DDES) with an improved RANS-LES hybrid model aimed at wall modelling
  in LES (WMLES). The system ensures a different response depending
  on whether the simulation does or does not have inflow turbulent
  content. In the first case, it reduces to WMLES: most of the turbulence
  is resolved except near the wall. Empirical improvements to this
  model relative to the pure DES equations provide a great increase
  of the resolved turbulence activity near the wall and adjust the
  resolved logarithmic layer to the modelled one, thus resolving the
  issue of "log layer mismatch" which is common in DES and other WMLES
  methods. An essential new element here is a definition of the subgrid
  length-scale which depends not only on the grid spacings, but also
  on the wall distance. In the case without inflow turbulent content,
  the proposed model performs as DDES, i.e., it gives a pure RANS solution
  for attached flows and a DES-like solution for massively separated
  flows. The coordination of the two branches is carried out by a blending
  function. The promise of the model is supported by its satisfactory
  performance in all the three modes it was designed for, namely, in
  pure WMLES applications (channel flow in a wide Reynolds-number range
  and flow over a hydrofoil with trailing-edge separation), in a natural
  DDES application (an airfoil in deep stall), and in a flow where
  both branches of the model are active in different flow regions (a
  backward-facing-step flow).},

  abstract = {Recently, the application of turbochargers is increasing because they
  are effective in improving fuel consumption of engines. One of the
  most important turbocharger characteristics is compressor operating
  range, since it has been used in various driving patterns with the
  advent of variable geometry turbochargers. Owing to the complicated
  phenomena, such as rotating stall occurring at low flow rate condition,
  flow analysis is very difficult and details of flow structure have
  not been fully understood for a long time since the early 1970s.
  In this study, two compressors with different operating range width
  were investigated with experimental and computational flow analysis.
  In the compressor with narrow operating range, the amplitude of blade
  passing pressure fluctuation decreases rapidly and rotating stall
  occurs near surging. On the other hand, in the compressor with wide
  operating range, the blockage by the tip leakage vortex breakdown
  play a role in stabilizing the flow field and keeping up a high performance
  even at low flow rates.},

  review = {Tomita et al. \cite{tomita2013effect} studied two compressors with
  similar map except in surge vicinity. Unsteady pressure measurements
  performed just upstream impeller leading edge at low mass flow rate
  revealed differences between compressors: the one with the narrowest
  operating range shown large pressure fluctuations at subsynchronous
  speeds moving circunferentially at about 50\%-80\% of compressor
  speed, whereas compressor with wide operating range did not exhibit
  this large amplitude fluctuations.
  
  
  3D CFD numerical simulations were also performed in order to analyze
  fluid phenomena at this low mass flow rate conditions. Compressor
  with less surge margin presented a tornado-type vortex between blades,
  blocking the incoming flow. This vortex is convected downstream and
  a new one is created in the adjacent blade, in a rotating stall pattern.
  Conversely, spiral-type tip leakage vortex breakdown occurred at
  all blades for compressor with higher surge margin. Some rotating
  instability was observed in this compressor, but not as severe as
  the rotating stall experienced as in the other compressor.
  
  
  The authors concluded that onset of tip leakage vortex breakdown earlier
  than leading edge separation could stabilize the flow structure and
  thus increase surge margin.},

  if a comparatively small integration area must be taken. In this
  basic study, a circular cylinder with a diameter of 6.0 mm is used;
  the spatially integrated sound pressure is compared with the actual
  sound pressure which is measured with a microphone. Further, the
  sound sources evaluated using only the flow field are determined,
  which give us detailed information about the amplitude and phase
  of the sound source structure. This direct evaluation method for
  the dipole sound is applicable to a more complex body.},

  abstract = {The tip clearance flows of transonic compressor rotors are important
  because they have a significant impact on rotor and stage performance.
  A wall-bounded shear layer formed by the relative motion between
  the overtip leakage flow and the shroud wall is found to have a major
  influence on the development of the tip clearance flow field. This
  shear layer, which has not been recognized by earlier investigators,
  impacts the stable operating range of the rotor. Simulation accuracy
  is dependent on the ability of the numerical code to resolve this
  layer. While numerical simulations of these flows are quite sophisticated,
  they are seldom verified through rigorous comparisons of numerical
  and measured data because these kinds of measurements are rare in
  the detail necessary to be useful in high-speed machines. In this
  paper we compare measured tip-clearance flow details (e.g., trajectory
  and radial extent) with corresponding data obtained from a numerical
  simulation. Laser-Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) measurements acquired
  in a transonic compressor rotor, NASA Rotor 35, are used. The tip
  clearance flow field of this transonic rotor is simulated using a
  Navier-Stokes turbomachinery solver that incorporates an advanced
  k-e turbulence model derived for flows that are not in local equilibrium.
  A simple method is presented for determining when the wall-bounded
  shear layer is an important component of the tip clearance flow field.},

  performance have been investigated experimentally and numerically
  in a centrifugal compressor. In order to accurately calculate the
  real tip clearance, the influence of impeller geometry deformation
  caused by the thermal load (temperature variation) and mechanical
  loads (aerodynamic pressure and centrifugal force) under working
  condition on the compressor aerodynamic performance is taken into
  account by fluid/solid interaction method during the computational
  fluid dynamics flow field analysis process. In this article, tip
  clearance flow under the real working environment is investigated
  with three different tip clearance cases. The impeller deformation
  combined with the adjustment of tip clearance causes some influence
  on the aerodynamic performance and on the structure reliability of
  the compressor system. For the aerodynamic design, an increase in
  the impeller tip clearance decreases the overall pressure rise and
  isentropic efficiency of the compressor, mainly due to the tip clearance
  loss in the impeller. Regarding structure design, the uniform relative
  tip clearance from the inlet to the outlet CR = 7.3 per cent is changed
  to non-uniform distribution from 6.4 per cent to 4.15 per cent. The
  largest deformation location occurs at the blade inducer and trailing-edge
  tip. The relative clearance near the outlet of the blade is reduced
  about 3.15 per cent which will cause great influence on the impeller
  working reliability.},

  In this way, tip clearance changed from a uniform clearance ratio
  of 7.3\% into a non-uniform profile that presents greater reduction
  with increasing meridional coordinate (CR is 50\% larger at the leading
  edge than at the trailing edge). Moreover, incident and exit blade
  metal angles were also deformed. Particularly, tip outlet angle at

  was investigated in the ERCOFTAC Centrifugal Pump, a testcase from
  the ERCOFTAC Turbomachinery Special Interest Group [1]. The case
  studied was presented by Comb√®s at the ERCOFTAC Seminar and Workshop
  on Turbomachinery Flow Prediction VII, in Aussois, 1999 [2]. It has
  7 impeller blades, 12 diffuser vanes and 6% vaneless radial gap,
  and operates at the nominal operating condition with a Reynolds number
  of 6.5 ? 105 at a constant rotational speed of 2000 rpm. 2D and 3D
  models were generated to investigate the interaction between the
  flow in the impeller and that in the vaned diffuser using the finite
  volume method. The incompressible Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes
  equations were solved together with the standard k-? turbulence model.
  Both steady-state and unsteady simulations are employed for the 2D
  and 3D models. A Generalized Grid Interface (GGI) is implemented
  both in the steady-state simulations, where the GGI is used to couple
  the meshes of the rotor and stator, and in unsteady simulations,
  where the GGI is applied between the impeller and the diffuser to
  facilitate a sliding approach [3]. Several numerical schemes are
  considered such as Euler, Backward and Crank-Nicholson (with several
  off-centering coefficients) time discretization, and upwind and linear
  upwind convection discretization. Furthermore, the choice of different
  maximum Courant number and different unsteady solvers have been studied,
  and the required computational time has been compared for all the
  cases. The ensemble-averaged velocity components and the distribution
  of the ensemble-averaged static pressure coefficient at the impeller
  front end are calculated and compared against the available experimental
  data provided by Ubaldi [4]. The computational results show good
  agreement with the experimental results, although the upwind convection
  discretization fails in capturing the unsteady impeller wakes in
  the vaned diffuser. The case with a maximum Courant number of 4 is
  regarded as having the most efficient set-up, predicting the unsteadiness
  of the flow with a large time-step.},

  abstract = {This study concerns a 2.5 pressure ratio centrifugal compressor stage
  consisting of a splittered unshrouded impeller and a vaned diffuser.
  The aim of this paper is to investigate the modifications of the
  flow structure when the operating point moves from peak efficiency
  to near stall. The investigations are based on the results of unsteady
  three-dimensional simulations, in a calculation domain comprising
  all the blade. A detailed analysis is given in the impeller inducer
  and in the vaned diffuser entry region through time-averaged and
  unsteady flow field. In the impeller inducer, this study demonstrates
  that the mass flow reduction from peak efficiency to near stall leads
  to intensification of the secondary flow effects. The low momentum
  fluid accumulated near the shroud interacts with the main flow through
  a shear layer zone. At near stall condition, the interface between
  the two flow structures becomes unstable leading to vortices development.
  In the diffuser entry region, by reducing the mass flow, the high
  incidence angle from the impeller exit induces a separation on the
  diffuser vane suction side. At near stall operating point, vorticity
  from the separation is shed into vortex cores which are periodically
  formed and convected downstream along the suction side.},

  review = {Bousquet et al. \cite{bousquet2014analysis} conducted a numerical
  study of a centrifugal compressor. Three operating points were studied
  from peak efficiency to near stall conditions. A virtual probe linked
  to the relative relative frame located at 90\% span at the impeller
  inlet was used for spectral analysis. Signal is recorded during 6
  impeller rotations after obtaining a stable state at near stall conditions,
  whereas 1 rotation is registered by the monitor at the other two
  working points.
  
  
  BPF tone is the main feature for the two operating conditions with
  higher mass flow. Near stall, lower frequency content appears, particularly
  a tone at a frequency 6 times the rotation order. Flow investigation
  reveals that 6 vortices are formed a shed per revolution, thus being
  responsible of the observed tone.
  
  
  Frequency content below rotation order is not investigated by the
  authors, probably because it would have required a higher recording
  period.},

  was investigated. Fully three-dimensional viscous steady-state computational
  fluid dynamics (CFD) was applied to simulate the flow in a 4.2:1
  design pressure ratio compressor for automotive application. Computed
  performance characteristics are presented for low- and high-pressure
  ratio operating conditions, with and without an overhung volute.
  The volute was found to severely harm aerodynamic stability of the
  investigated compressor when operating at lower than design mass
  flow. The relative narrowing effect of the volute on compressor map
  width increases with pressure ratio up to a 42 per cent drop in stable
  flow range at design speed. The inter-passage variations in performance
  quantities and the influence of the volute tongue region are discussed
  in detail. The circumferential variations of incidence angle correlate
  with rotational speed, which, in combination with the higher sensitivity
  to incidence angle at transonic inflow conditions, seems to deteriorates
  stability when transonic inflow conditions are reached.},
