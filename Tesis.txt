Abstract
As turbocharging requirements raise to face an increasingly stricter environmental regulation of internal combustion engines, concerns regarding
their acoustic emission become more pressing. Since downsized engines
require higher boost pressures and lower mass flow rates, the turbocharger
compressor is forced to work at more unstable regimes, where flow patterns
become more complex and noise levels rise.
This thesis aims to investigate these issues, proposing methodologies to
characterize the acoustic emission of turbocharger compressors and implementing them in different experiments with a special focus on the the link
between acoustic emission and flow behaviour at unstable conditions.
A literature review is carried out in order to assess the state of the art regarding specially experimental techniques related to this issue but also including
the latest developments in terms of understanding the flow characteristics
through numerical simulations. Different methodologies are consequently
proposed and implemented into a custom flow rig inside an anechoic chamber as to experimentally measure and post-process the acoustic output of
the compressor.
From this measurement campaign a characterization of the noise spectral
content across the compressor map is obtained and described, identifying different acoustical phenomena such as blade passing tonal noise, low
frequency content associated to deep surge, higher frequency broadband
ascribed to tip clearance interaction, and broadband noise in the plane wave
range known as “whoosh” in the literature, of special concern for automotive
manufacturers. This particular phenomenon is detected even at more stable
conditions at higher flow rate, and rising in level as flow rate is diminished
to the point of being masked by lower frequency content.
After a validation of the selected procedure in realistic engine conditions,
experimental data is compared against a numerical model of the compressor
developed in a parallel work to assess its validity and propose different post-

vii

processing techniques to extract additional insights about the behaviour of
the flow at different conditions, hinting at the main generation mechanism
for “whoosh” being located at the compressor diffuser.
Since numerical simulations predict a reduced amount of reversed unstable
flow at conditions where “whoosh” noise is still measured, an experimental
campaign is performed were detailed measures of local temperature near
the compressor wheel are used to determine the evolution of reversed flow,
with supplemental readings through pressure probes in the inducer and
diffuser being used to link this evolution with the fluctuation of spectral
content. Temperature measurements are also correlated with measurements
of the velocity field through particle imaging. Results show that even inducer
content being highly affected by the onset of reversed flow, “whoosh” noise
is detected at all tested conditions
Different experimental campaigns are then described were modifications
of the inlet geometry immediately upstream the compressor are performed
in order to assess how the air flow presentation can influence acoustic performance. Geometries featuring reservoirs, nozzles and guide vanes are
shown to potentially reduce noise levels. A 90º elbow parametric study
is performed, demonstrating how the inner radius of the elbow influences
circumferential temperature differences and noise levels, leading to the
hypothesis of geometry influence on “whoosh” noise being related to air
presentation changes that promote lower or higher growth of reversed backflow, which in turns carries upstream the spectral content being generated
in the compressor diffuser.
Lastly, additional experimental and numerical studies are proposed to
further explore these issues, in order to provide a better understanding of
how inlet designs may delay and mitigate the appearance and transmission
of these adverse acoustical phenomena.

“Hundreds of noises wove themselves into a wiry texture of sound
with barbs protruding here and there, smart edges running
along it and subsiding again, with clear notes splintering off and
dissipating. By this noise alone, whose special quality cannot be
captured in words, a man returning after years of absence would
have been able to tell with his eyes shut that he was back in the
Imperial Capital and Royal City of Vienna.”

CHAPTER 1

Introduction
“The story is set in the year 1922 and has its main
character, Mr Engelbert, moving to Prague from the
countryside to live out his retirement years and struggling
to cope with the aggressive modernity of the city. The
horror is not the power of money or the arrogance of
the people, but the noise; not the age-old noise of a
thunderstorm or a hammer, but the new noise of engines,
especially of automobiles and motor-cycles, the explosive
internal combustion monsters.”

Milan Kundera, The Curtain.

As Milan Kundera so eloquently wrote, the noise produced by internal combustion vehicles has radically changed the way we understand cities; even
many decades before we understood the dangers that chemical emissions
pose to the environment and our health, noise emissions were without a
doubt a commotion for urban inhabitants worldwide: an horrific, roaring
hallmark of accelerated progress.
Nowadays, no one is surprised anymore by the sound of an automobile or
a “motor-cycle”. Even the mere absence of this familiar, background urban
sound is unsettling to many. Road traffic is, however, the main source of
noise pollution in cities. As an example, Fig 1.1 depicts global noise levels
in the city of Valencia.
It can be clearly seen how automotive vehicles define the noise environment
in our cities; high-traffic roads appear as higher level sources of noise that
propagates towards less travelled areas. The (traffic-restricted) campus of
Universitat Politècnica de València, where this thesis has been developed,
appears as a blue, quieter island at the upper right part of the figure.

noise pollution. Scale shows normalized levels from quieter (1) to noisier (6).

Noise emission by automotive vehicles is, however, a sum of very complex
phenomena. One could consider, intuitively, that the dominant factor of this
sum must be the combustion noise itself: several explosions going off every
second of operation, their vibration propagating through the metallic engine
block and radiating through the air.
However, many of other sources of noise exist in a vehicle: aerodynamic
noise produced as air flows around the structures and through the intake
and exhaust pipes, friction noise of the tires against the asphalt of the road,
mechanical noise of the engine parts working together, auxiliary systems
such as fuel injection, pumps and, increasingly important, the noise produced
by the turbocharger group.

1.1. Turbochargers
The idea of using a compressor to increase the density of air available in the
combustion chamber of an engine is now more than a century old. While
Gottlieb Daimler’s 1885 patent included a supercharging mechanical pump,
and Louis Renault’s 1902 patent featured a centrifugal supercharger, the
first design for a turbocharger (this is, a supercharging compressor driven by
the exhaust gasses) was presented in Alfred Büchi’s 1905 patent Nº204630
from the Imperial Patent Office of the German Reich.

Normalized relevance [%]

While some racing and luxury sport cars had supercharged engines (the
popular Mercedes Kompressor series started in 1921), most mass produced
cars used simpler, naturally aspirating engines.
During the first half of the XX century, the primary area of application of
turbocharging where marine and, specially, aviation engines. The addition
of turbocharging to aircraft engines allowed them to counter the diminishing
air density at high altitude, increasing the available power and operating
ceiling. For instance, the first product made by Cliff Garrett’s corporation
was a supercharged air cooler for the B-17 Flying Fortress.
It was not until the sixties that turbocharging made its appearance into the
popular automotive market, with the Chevrolet Corvair Monza and the aptly
named Oldsmobile Jetfire. However, technology was still not very reliable,
and they were quickly retired from the dealerships.
The scene changed radically during the seventies. Several factors (the oil
crisis, enhanced reliability, stringent emission requirements, turbocharged
cars winning Formula 1 and Le Mans races) made possible the first successful
passenger diesel cars, that grew during the 80s and 90s to dominate the
diesel automotive market.
To illustrate this evolution, Fig. 1.2 shows how words like “turbocharger”
and “traffic noise” started to appear in English literature. We can see a
sudden bump of “turbocharger” mentions following the start of WWII (where
turbocharging aircraft quickly became norm), but the peak of popularity
appears in the 80s. Concern for “traffic noise” on the other hand suddenly
boosts from 1965 to 1975.

This figure also shows how from the last years of the XX century, social
concern for the nocive effects of pollutant emissions has grown. These
include NOx , CO, CO2 , particulate matter (PM) and so on. In a bid to lower
emissions, a trend of downsizing engines has become popular, aiming to
increase efficiency and lower contaminants by reducing the displacement
and cylinder count, in both petrol and diesel markets. Upcoming regulations
are even more stringent [7], so this tendency is only expected to grow.
As power and torque must be maintained in these reduced displacement
engines, turbocharging requirements increase, becoming more and more
popular in the petrol market as well. Further information on the relationship
between stringent emissions policies, downsizing and turbocharging can be
found in the work of Schumann et al. [8].

1.2. Noise emissions
Another important aspect of increasing concern for both regulators and
consumers is the so-called NVH (Noise, Vibration and Harshness) problems
that opened this chapter.
While downsizing increases efficiency and allows engines to better meet
emission requirements, this strategy has some downsides. For instance,
it has been shown [9] that at certain operating conditions, a downsized
engine will radiate higher noise levels than an equivalent engine of larger
displacement.
Increased turbocharging requirements also imply that the compressor
must work near its limiting conditions, such as the surge limit [10], where
compressor airflow is so low that it reverses, allowing hot air to escape the
compressor upstream instead of downstream. This potentially destructive
condition is initiated with flow instabilities that are also linked to increased
noise output, as will be further explored along this work.
Another factor that must be taken into account during the analysis of
acoustical emissions is that raw noise quantity (overall level) is not the only
concern, for noise quality (for example, its particular frequency distribution)
is also an important problem, regarding both the possibilities of sound mitigation and psychoacoustic response by the customer, as shown in [11] and
the work of Nor et al.[12].

1.3. State of the art
These concerns have led to a thriving research effort regarding turbocharging
efficiency, usefulness to reduce pollution and contribution to noise emissions.
Several approaches to this problem are being tested. Some researchers
conduct experimental analysis of the internal fluid flow of the compressor.
Others focus their interest in the externally radiated acoustic field. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations are carried out in order to visualize
the different flow phenomena inside and near the compressor.
Aside from experimental or numerical characterization of the acoustic
problem, its mitigation is also being actively investigated. Options range from
the modification of inlet or casing geometries, to the addition of different
silencers and resonators on the compressor pipes.
Through this research, different acoustical phenomena have been identified. While some like the tonal noise produced by the blade pass (known as
Blade Passing Frequency or BPF) have a clear, straightforward explanation,
others are not yet fully understood.
For example, a certain wideband noise known as “whoosh” in the literature
has been lately of interest, with explanations for its generation ranging from
turbulent vorticity to fluid interaction with tip clearance (the gap between
the wheel blades and the casing wall). Further research is currently ongoing
on this particular phenomenon.

1.4. Objectives
The objective of this thesis is threefold, covering not only the experimental
acoustic analysis itself but also its methodological and application aspects.
To sum up, the different but related objectives can be enumerated as:
Enlarging the corpus of published experimental results of turbocharger
compressor acoustic measurements across its different operating conditions: as the literature is still reduced, expanding it will improve not
only understanding of known phenomena but will also identify other
areas that may be of interest for further research.
Presenting a comprehensive experimental methodology, from instrumentation to measuring procedures and signal processing, in order
to consistently and reliably characterize acoustic emissions, ensuring
at the same time the robustness of these techniques when faced with
real engine conditions.

Exploring how this experimental methodology can be applied not only
to the characterization of the internal sound field, but also to the
initialization and validation of numerical simulations, the analysis of
the influence of unstable flow phenomena at marginal surge conditions
and the study of the effect of different inlet geometries on noise
generated by the compressor.

1.5. Thesis outline
After this introduction that constitutes chapter 1, a comprehensive literature
review on turbocharger compressor noise research will be carried out in
chapter 2. This review will introduce relevant developments regarding experimental compressor testing, but also some literature concerning numerical
simulations that are of vital importance to improve the understanding of the
flow field causing the acoustical emission.
Chapter 3 will present the different methodologies used in the experimental campaign performed during this thesis, along with the facilities and
equipment used to this effect. These methodologies mainly include procedures for the characterization of the internal sound field, but also some for
measuring external sound radiation will be introduced. Theoretical background, limitations and best practices regarding the use of the presented
techniques will be also discussed.
The results of the experimental campaign carried out using the described
methodology will constitute chapter 4. Pressure spectra will be used to
indentify relevant acoustic phenomena, and noise maps and spectrograms
will be used to analyze the evolution of these phenomena across the different
operating conditions of the compressor.
On chapter 5, procedures described on chapter 3 will then be implemented
on an engine test cell in order to assess their performance in real engine
conditions. This performance will be compared to established methods such
as the two-microphone method and the pressure-pressure intensity probe.
While external measurements are difficult in a non-anechoic environment
such as the engine test cell, an example of the acoustical particle velocity
method will be tested to overcome this limitation.
Chapter 6 will explore how the obtained experimental results can be used
to initialize and validate numerical simulations. In turn, these simulations
can provide insight into particularities of the flow field by using different post-

processing techniques, and also suggest further experimental measurements
that can be relevant for the understanding of the phenomena involved in
the generation of noise.
Detailed characterization of the flow field and its thermodynamic variables
in the inducer and final section of the compressor inlet duct will enable
further comprehension of how stalled flow cells reverse and reintegrate
into the main flow, and the relation of this phenomenon with the acoustic
emission. Chapter 7 will be devoted to the measurement and analysis of
this issue.
As influence of the inlet geometry immediately upstream of the compressor
wheel has been proved of significant relevance in both compressor performance and noise emission, chapter 8 will present an experimental study of
different geometries and their influence on the the compressor behaviour
with special emphasis on noise emission.
Finally, chapter 9 will offer the conclusions that have been reached through
the experimental campaign and analysis of results, along with suggestions
of future works that could be carried out to advance knowledge of the topic.

CHAPTER 2

Literature review
In order to provide a better context for the development of this work, a
literature review has been carried out. Special emphasis has been put
into existing experimental research of automotive turbocharger acoustics,
although techniques and results from related fields are also presented when
applicable.
For instance, numerical simulations on the topic are becoming more numerous. They offer further insight into the underlying flow structures even
if clear, causal correlations have not yet been demonstrated. As such, these
studies merit their own specific section.
Another point related to these flow structures that deserves interest is
the analysis of how the particularities of the inlet geometry immediately
upstream of the compressor wheel influence the performance and the noise
emission of the system. Not only this influence offers clues of which mechanisms are responsible for certain acoustic phenomena, but they also present
an interesting possibility of mitigation.

2.1. Experimental research
While the acoustical emission of axial compressors has been a subject of
extensive research since more than fifty years ago [13, 14], studies performed
on centrifugal turbocharger are more comparatively more scarce.
Of the existing literature dealing with centrifugal turbomachinery, many
efforts were directed at large fans or centrifugal pumps, with small turbochargers have begun only recently to be more relevant.

9

Among the first it is worth to mention the extensive research carried out
at Pennsylvania State University, where at least since the nineties [15] an
instrumented centrifugal pump was installed in an anechoic flow bench to
characterize its acoustical performance.
This setup allowed several researchers to conduct experiments analysing
not only in-duct noise, as in the works of Mongeau et al. [15, 16] and
radiated noise, as shown by Choi et al. [17, 18], but also pressure distribution
on the blade surface [15, 17].
A related experimental campaign, starting at least from the turn of the
millennium, was carried out at the University of Siegen. Here, Wolfram and
Carolus [19] used again a centrifugal pump inside an anechoic chamber.
In this case, measurements were done relying in anemometers directed
at the blades that could be rotated at will in order to analyse azimuthal
rotating modes [20]. Radiated noise could be also measured using a single
microphone [21].
Both Penn State and Siegen campaigns show significant aspects of interest
such as the identification of Blade Passing Frequency (BPF) peaks on the
acoustic spectrum and hints on the link between stall and noise [15]. Relevant dimensionless numbers such as the Strouhal and Helmoltz numbers
are also suggested [16].
However, it is important to notice that there are important differences
between these large centrifugal pumps and small turbocharger compressor
for automotive purposes.
These differences are found not only in the geometrical design aspect but
also in the order of rotational speed. While the considered pumps do not
exceed 3600 rpm, small automotive turbochargers can exceed 200 krpm.
Also, they are affected by the pulsating flow of the reciprocating engine,
which will be present in the acoustic signature as well. This later aspect will
be shown in chapter 5.
In order to address these differences and focus the literature review in the
specific issues presented by turbocharger compressors, selected works from
the literature will be reviewed in the following subsections, placing special
attention in both the measurement techniques and the acoustical results
obtained.

2.1.1. Methods for turbocharger noise characterization
Although not numerous, acoustical research works on small, centrifugal
turbocharger compressors can be found in the literature. Many of them are
published by automotive or compressor manufacturers, who are among the
most concerned about compressor noise emissions.
Starting from the work of Trochon [22] and Evans and Ward [23, 24] up
to more recent investigations such as those of Åbom, Kabral and Rammal
[25, 26] at the Swedish Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), several different
methodologies for characterising the acoustical emission of automotive
turbochargers can be found.
A first division can be made between those studies aiming to measure
internal flow noise, placing sensors inside the compressor housing or inlet
and outlet ducts, and those works based on external measurements of the
radiated noise.
Evans and Ward [23, 24] opted for a simple setup of four microphones
to measure sound radiation. These four microphones were situated on the
same plane and directed to a turbocharger-equipped engine. They were
distributed at 90º with a separation of one meter from the engine. From the
pressure readings of these four microphones, Sound Pressure Level (SPL)
was computed and then averaged among them, in order to get a single signal
from which spectrograms and sound spectra could be derived.
A similar setup was used by Teng and Homco [10] (see specially Fig. 1) in
order to test different countermeasures for whoosh noise mitigation, such
as engine calibration, resonators in the compressor inlet/outlet, compressor
trim variation and a swirl generation device.
This kind of averaging four spatially-distributed microphones method was
implemented in the anechoic chamber in order to characterize the far-field
radiated sound of the turbocharger group during the experimental campaign;
further information will provided on subsection 3.4.2 of chapter 3.
Apart from the far-field radiation, another acoustic problem of interest
is that of orifice noise, this is, the noise created by the ingestion of the air
stream into the opening of the turbocharger inlet duct.
Lee et al. [27] used a Brüel & Kjær free field type microphone pointed at
the compressor inlet as seen in Fig. 8 of the reference. It can also be noted
that in order to avoid “flow effects”, the microphone was located 0.8 away
from the inlet.

The setup selected by Guillou et al. [28] to measure ingestion noise was
very similar. Here, a single microphone was positioned aligned with the
axis of the turbocharger at a distance of 0.4 m, again facing directly to the
compressor inlet bell mouth.
Another solution was implemented by Figurella et al. in [29]. In this case,
a Brüel & Kjær type 2235 Sound Level Meter was positioned 0.25 m from the
inlet duct orifice, at a 45º angle from the inlet axis. In [30] Figurella et al.
opted instead to rely on a ¼” microphone affixed at the same position, 0.25
m away from the orifice and 45º from the axis. Both instruments appear in
Fig. 1 of [30].
During the experimental campaign that was carried out for the development of this thesis, two free field microphones were situated at a distance
of 10 and 20 cm from the inlet pipe orifice. This will be expanded in detail
in subsection 3.4.1 of chapter 3.
Finally, a third approach for the characterization of compressor noise is
based on measuring the sound field inside the inlet and outlet ducts, usually
by means of fast pressure sensors. This has the advantage of not needing to
ensure anechoic conditions in the test cell. Another remarkable advantage
is that, by analysing the flow field alone, one can avoid the influence of the
radiative properties of the duct material and geometry.
As these advantages make this last approach specially interesting for a
research centred on the sources of aero-acoustical generated noise, emphasis
has been put in reviewing existing literature dealing with internal flow noise.
Early work by Trochon [22] dealt with the acoustic characterization of
turbocharger noise measuring in-duct airborne noise at the compressor exit
(see Fig. 1 of the reference) during engine operation.
Gaudé et al. [6] from Honeywell Turbo Technologies presented an extensive review of different vibro-acoustic sources of turbocharger noise. Both
accelerometers and pressure sensors affixed to the pipes were used, and
their use to identify some vibro-acoustic phenomena was demonstrated.
While this work omits a proper, referenced methodology description, it mentions that acoustic noise intensity is calculated using wave decomposition by
means of three sensors, indicating the range of plane wave for the installed
ducts.
Raitor and Neise [31] used different methods, taking into account the
presence of acoustic modes in the duct. The first one consisted on a ½"
microphone equipped with a turbulence screen and mounted in a rotatable section of the duct. This allows the measurement of circumferentially

averaged sound pressure level (SPL), in accordance with ISO 5136. This
rotatable section can also be fitted with four consecutive rings, each with
four flush-mounted condenser microphones for analysis of acoustic modes.
This last technique is similar to that used in the previously mentioned
work by Guillou et al. [28], where four Kulite model XCS-190-5D miniature
pressure sensors were mounted on the compressor inlet adaptor, equally
separated 90º. A single Kulite model XTEL-160-50G was used on the outlet
duct.
A single in-duct fast pressure sensor was also the technique selected by
Figurella et al. [29, 30]. In this case Kistler piezoresistive transducers were
used, both in the compressor inlet duct (model 4045A2) and in the outlet
duct (model 4045A2 or 4045A5).
Pai et al. [32, 33] opted as well for a single sensor (in this case labelled as
a microphone) to measure sound pressure level inside the compressor inlet
duct. An ambient microphone was present as well, but its readings are not
included in their work.
A different approach was taken by Tiijoka et al. [34], who describe the
use of an array of three pressure transducers in both inlet and outlet pipes of
their compressor setup (see Figs. 1-3 of the reference). In order to estimate
the strength of the propagating nodes, a cross-spectra averaging technique
was used.

In table 2.1 a synthesis of the information compiled in this subsection is
presented. It can be seen how only one reference [6] used sound intensity,
which is inherently a more robust magnitude. Sound pressure level, on
the other hand, is easily influenced by the particular geometric setup and
measurement location. It is also apparent that, while measurements have
been presented regarding inlet, outlet, orifice and external noise, no study
as far (as the author knows) has been presented regarding all four options
simultaneously.

2.1.2. Relevant results
After reviewing the different methods available in the literature regarding
turbocharger noise, a selection of relevant acoustical results from these
works is analyzed in this subsection. It is worth noting that while some
of the referred research was directly aimed at characterizing noise output,
other works had different objectives and only used noise measurement as a
metric, without discussing its characteristics or generation process.
An interesting introduction is provided by Gaudé et al. whose work collects
a variety of different noise-generating phenomena in turbochargers [6].
Table 2.2 reproduces this classification. Several tone sources are proposed,
mainly linked to the imbalance of the rotor and irregularities and lack of
symmetry of the compressor wheel. Another source of tones is the passing
of the blades of both turbine and compressor, in special the main ones in
the case of the later.
Besides the different tones and their associated harmonics, a broadband
noise is identified as “hiss”, whose source mechanism is listed as related to
turbulence in the compressor stage. The frequency range of this turbulencerelated phenomenon is proposed as 0 – 20 kHz, but no further insight is
given.
A similar division was anticipated by Trochon [22], who classified turbocharger compressor noise in “pulsation noise” (the tonal noise caused by
the blade rotation) and “blow noise”, a broadband noise (named this way
for its resemblance to noise produced by a leakage). It is attributed by the
author to aerodynamic turbulence “inside the compressor” at high mass flow
and low shaft speed. By examining Fig. 1 of the reference we can assess the
presence of such a broadband noise between 1.5 and 2.5 kHz.
Evans and Ward [23] address explicitly the issue of a so-called “whoosh”
noise. This noise is identified as being “in general” of the broadband type.
The authors state that this noise is typically present from 750 Hz to in
excess of 10 kHz. they note however that most of the energy is apparently

distributed between 1.5 and 3 kHz. This appears to be similar to the “hiss”
noise mentioned in the previous reference, but in this case the authors point
out that the occurrence of whoosh appears to be specifically associated with
operation close to surge. In this situation, blade stall, reverse flow and
recirculation of intake air generate increased turbulence.
Raitor and Neise [31] mention instead the so-called “tip clearance noise”
(TCN), referring to a noise with broadband spectral content below the blade
passing frequency (BPF). A similarity is drawn with the work of Kameier and
Neise [35] regarding axial turbo compressors, where a rotating instability
linked to stall cell propagation is discussed. This TCN is marked in Fig. 8 of
the reference as located between 3 kHz and 5.5 kHz in the inlet duct. BPF is
also marked in the figure, including its harmonics. An intense “buzz-saw”
multi-tonal noise is apparent at higher speeds in the inlet, but not so in
the outlet (see Fig. 10 of the reference). TCN appears in the outlet duct
as well. Mach number at the impeller tip is also highlighted as signalling
the transition between TCN vs. BPF dominance. Furthermore, a broadband
appears between 1.2–2 kHz, with a smaller one at 2–2.8 kHz, both being
similar to the aforementioned “whoosh” noise.
Following the work of Evans and Ward, Teng and Homco [10] obtained
further insight on the precise location of the whoosh noise for their setup.
Especially, in Fig. 5 of the reference the authors identify whoosh noise as

appearing in the 4.5 to 7 kHz band. BPF tone is not seen on the figure,
which is limited to a maximum frequency of 10 kHz. This suggests that BPF
is either of higher frequency, a condition which for the kind of compressor
described would be normal, thus indicating that this broadband noise is
again below this frequency. In order to confirm the relation between surge
inception and whoosh noise, a type K thermocouple was affixed very close
to the compressor inlet. An apparent correlation between temperature rise
and 5 to 7 kHz sound pressure content is found in Fig. 7 of the reference,
with the authors suggesting that the presence of hot back-flow air due blade
stall is related to the identified whoosh noise.
Guillou et al. [28] do not directly address the noise spectra in their study.
Nonetheless, the authors plot the pressure FFT in the outlet duct for various
flow regimes. It can be seen in their Fig. 7, specially in the lower right plot
(stable regime), how a clear broadband appears between 2 and 3.5 kHz. This
phenomenon continues to be present in both stall and surge regimes, but
in those conditions it becomes masked by the strong low frequency signals
that are typical of surge.
Lee et al. [27] focus their work on “pulsation noise”, asserting that it is
caused by unbalance of shaft and blades, and BPF noise, caused by the cyclic
motion of the blades. Its harmonics are also observed and mentioned (see
Figs. 9 and 10 of the reference). The authors also observe a noticeable
hump in the same figures, but they argue that, since it was not reported
by the turbocharger manufacturer, it can be dismissed as caused by the
experimental setup. Note that this broadband noise appeared in this case
between 3 and 4.5 kHz. Interestingly, it was also present even when the
compressor was running without inlet and outlet ducts (see Fig. 11 of the
reference), suggesting an internal source.
Tiikoja et al. [34] revisit the topic making again a distinction between two
contributing phenomena. Stationary distortions are identified as leading
to periodic tones. Given an absence of inflow disturbances these tones are
referred to as rotor-alone tonal noise. Fluctuating pressure fields caused
by the interaction of inlet and outlet guide vanes and the rotor is regarded
as a secondary source which will introduce tonal noise at harmonics of the
BPF. On the other hand, a wide band noise is ascribed to non-stationary
disturbances (turbulence), but its importance for turbochargers is dismissed.
Denomination of buzz-saw noise for the tonal phenomena is used and attributed to rotating shock waves attached to the blades whose tips reach
supersonic conditions. TCN is also named and marked as such in the results,
appearing in this case between 5 and 10 kHz in the outlet and between 4

and 7.5 kHz in the inlet. A smaller broadband is visible but not marked by
the authors. This broadband is located between 0.6 and 2.5 kHz, in a way
more consistent with the aforementioned reports of “whoosh” noise at these
lower frequencies.

[29]. Discrete sound peaks (tones) were cited as the

speed and blade pass frequencies (rotor speed times 10

is named as “whoosh or blow noise”. Results were 9 Tiijoka

frequency band is proposed. Again it is linked at operFrequency [kHz]
ation near surge, for instance in transient conditions
such as throttle tip-in or tip-in tip-out, but also to Figure 2.1: Frequency amplicertain steady driving condition in petrol engines. A tude of lower frequency broadmechanism is proposed where acoustic radial mode band noise found in selected turresonance may be acting as amplifier for pressure per- bocharger compressor literature,

of the spectrogram in Fig. 6 of the reference seems to
suggest, however, that if whoosh noise was indeed present at the measured
operating condition, its frequency location was between 4 and 5 kHz.
In synthesis, two different kinds of phenomena are consistently identified in
the literature regarding turbocharger compressors. One consists of the tonal
noises linked to the rotation of the wheel. In order to work, compressor
blades must maintain a pressure difference between their pressure and

suction sides. This creates rotating pressure differences, being the rotation
of the blades the mechanism imposing the frequency. Harmonics of this
frequency may appear, especially in transonic or supersonic conditions where
shock waves attach to the blades, thus creating more rotating pressure
gradients.
On the other hand, there is sufficient evidence of recurrent broadband
noise at frequencies below the BPF, having been reported between 1.5 and 7.5
kHz, as seen in Fig. 2.1. Two different phenomena (lower frequency whoosh
between approximately 1–4 kHz and so-called TCN at higher frequencies)
seem to exist, with authors sometimes conflating the two. In contrast with
BPF tonal noise, there is no clear mechanism proposed as being the cause
of these broadband noises. As seen above, some authors vaguely ascribe
it to “turbulence”, others to stalled backflow interaction (including modal
resonance), tip clearance effects, etc. It is apparent that further research is
needed to clarify this issue.

2.2. Numerical simulations
Given the clues about the relationship between this broadband noise and
three-dimensional flow effects in and near the compressor impeller, and at
the same time the difficulties of their accurate experimental characterization,
it is worth considering the numerical simulation of the problem through
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).
The previously mentioned work by Lee et al. [27] included a CFD simulation of the compressor, matching experimentally measured operating
conditions. However no agreement was found between predicted and measured noise spectra (see Figs. 17 and 18 of the reference), possibly due to
reuse of only a single-revolution simulation. Karim et al. [36] successfully
used experimental results to confirm a CFD prediction of whoosh noise
diminishing, achieved by reducing length of leading edge step. However,
only overall results are shown, not noise spectra.
Plausible noise spectra of turbocharger compressor were shown by Mendonça et al. [37]. By examining Fig. 7 of their work, it is possible to
recognize the two aforementioned leading noise phenomena: BPF tonal
noise and its harmonics, and a broadband noise at a lower frequency. In

this case, the broadband is expressed as percentage of rotation order (RO1 ),
being located approximately at 0.5 to 0.9 RO (50% to 90% of shaft rotating
frequency). BPF peaks are noticeable only in the outlet ducts.
This last work appears to demonstrate that CFD simulations are indeed
able to reproduce noise phenomena whose existence was experimentally
assessed. However, caution should be exercised since (as shown for instance
by the results of Lee [27]) it is possible to produce CFD results that accurately
predict overall or averaged variables (efficiency, compression ratio, mass
flow) or even overall noise levels, but whose frequency content does not
match with experimental observations at all.
As a consequence, while plenty of works regarding turbocharger CFD
simulation exist in the literature, only those that present plausible validation
against acoustic experimental measurements (and not only against overall
or averaged thermodynamic measurements) can be relied upon in order to
extract insights about noise generation.
For instance, Hellstrom [38] presented CFD simulation results related to
the experimental visualization work done by Guillou [39], where qualitative
agreement is found between the predicted and measured flow structures.
Of special interest when considering CFD results is data such as the isosurface of negative axial velocity shown in Fig. 10 of the reference, showing
a spiral-like backflow structure that would be more difficult to identify
experimentally.
However, it is also possible to consider research works that, while not
specifically acoustic in nature, offer experimentally validated information
about the flow field near the compressor inlet, specially if simulated operating conditions were chosen with the intention of analysing stall or surge
phenomena. The work of Margot et al. [40] demonstrates how deep surge
can be numerically predicted and how low pressure zones upstream of the
compressor wheel lead to reversed flow in the periphery of the impeller (see
Fig. 11 of the reference).
Numerical analysis of this kind of flow reversion was carried out by Lang
[41]. Unsteady simulations of the compressor, including the outlet duct with
a throttle valve (replicating that of the experimental facility that was used
for validation) were performed, decreasing valve area to reduce flow from
stable to surge operating conditions. Good agreement was found between
predicted and measured instantaneous pressure.

Rotation order (RO) is frequency normalized by shaft speed (Hz/rotations per second)
so that RO = 1 is the frequency of shaft rotation and RO of BPF is equal to the number of
main blades.

Furthermore, three different inlet geometries were simulated: a straight
duct, an elbow and a reservoir. In the straight inlet case, a slight tapering of
the duct is present. Even in this case, reversed flow seems to extend up to
∼2.5 inducer diameters from the wheel leading edge. Different patterns for
reversed flow are attested for each geometry. Influence in surge margin is
clearly demonstrated both numerically and experimentally.
Regarding the higher frequency broadband phenomenon referred to as
TCN in the aforementioned works, a numerical analysis of the influence
of tip clearance was performed by Galindo et al. [42] where different
tip clearance ratios were simulated, resulting in no significant change in
the acoustic signature. Therefore, the precise flow mechanism behind this
particular phenomenon is not yet fully identified.

2.3. Local inlet flow field
Accurate characterization and modelling of the aforementioned unstable
reversed flows is thus necessary to validate CFD results and design and
evaluate the effect of corrective measures. Some indirect measurements
have been made taking advantage of the temperature rise that the inlet
experiences because of the high temperature of the compressed flow [43, 29].
Low frequency content and standard deviation of the pressure signals have
also been used to track the onset and growth of these unstable phenomena
[44].
Other tests have been performed to directly measure the flow velocity fields
through different velocimetry techniques such as Laser Doppler Anemometry
(LDA) [45], hot-wire anemometry (HWA) [46, 47] and Particle Imaging
Velocimetry (PIV) [48, 49, 45].
The latter technique is desirable for CFD validation as it allows the measurement of whole sections of the field instead of a single point such as in
the HWA and LDA techniques. Regarding the use of PIV in turbomachinery,
many of the studies available in the literature have been performed on large
centrifugal pumps [45, 50, 51], axial fans [52, 46] and axial compressors
[49, 48, 53, 54], usually with the aim to study the evolution of the flow
through the passages and the interaction with the diffuser vanes.
In the case of the works presented by Liu et al. [49] and Wernet [48,
53] an effort was also made to analyze the distribution of flow in planes
perpendicular to the channel direction so that the transversal velocity field
could be observed.

Even when proper centrifugal compressors were studied, attention was
still put in the diffuser passages, such as in the works of Voges et al. [55],
Ohuchida et al. [56] and Cukurel et al. [57]. In the three cases a small
transparent window is placed in the diffuser casing to record the passage
flow and interaction with the impeller wake.
The most relevant studies that instead of the diffuser considered the compressor inlet and the aforementioned backflow issue are those published
by Guillou, Gancedo et al. [28, 58, 59, 60] who used a test rig where a
turbocharger compressor was fitted with a bell mouth open inlet so that
images of the flow could be taken directly without any barrier as the seeded
ambient air was ingested. Hellström et al. [38] also used this setup to
perform a comparison with numerical CFD simulations.
During these experimental campaigns measurements of the transversal
velocity fields were conducted by illuminating the flow outside of the inlet
with a laser sheet perpendicular to the compressor axis and close to the bell
mouth. An interesting development of this approach was made in [60] where
a short polycarbonate ported shroud was fitted between the bell mouth and
the compressor. The laser sheet was then made to pass at different planes
through this transparent shroud.
On the other hand, axial velocity fields were measured in [28, 59] by
aligning the laser sheet with the compressor axis, and taking the snapshots
not perpendicular to it but at an angle, as the bell mouth was not transparent.
By doing this with two cameras an stereoscopic algorithm could be used
to reconstruct the true axial velocity field as if the camera were indeed
perpendicular to the illuminated plane.
However, it must be noted that in real world automotive applications the
compressor inlet is not open in this fashion but attached to a long duct that
houses the filter and flow meter. These ducts confine the reversed flow and
force its reintegration into the main flow. And since has also been proved that
the inlet geometry close to the compressor holds special relevance regarding
onset and frequency of the deep surge instabilities [61] effort should be put
into a characterization where the reversed flow is confined in he duct.

2.4. Influence of inlet geometry
Besides the aforementioned investigation of Lang [41], this influence of the
inlet geometry modification immediately upstream of the compressor wheel
(and thus, air presentation) on the performance and surge margin has been
established on the literature, as seen for example in Galindo et al. [62],
Serrano et al. [63] and Wang et al. [64].
Nonetheless, research has been focused on the improvement of surge margin and efficiency, while information about the influence of air presentation
on turbocharger compressor noise is scarce, if existent at all. Consequently,
one of the objectives of the present work is to experimentally assess this
acoustical influence and analyze the features of the flow field that may be
related to this acoustic emission.
This assessment must consider inlet modifications that are relevant to
recent industry developments and requirements, while at the same time
being simple enough to allow the establishment of general guidelines instead
of conclusions limited to very specific devices.
Reviewing published works, one of the most simple modifications consists
of the installation of an elbow upstream of the compressor inlet. These
elbows are used sometimes to overcome packaging limitations. However,
they cause pressure loss [65, 66] and flow distortion [63] that have adverse
impact on compressor efficiency.
Concerning the acoustical influence, Li et al. [66] do consider the influence
of the elbow over pressure spectral content at various locations. Of special
interest is the analysis of BPF amplitude variation, which is attested experimentally (see Figs. 16 and 18 of the reference). The authors concluded
that some interaction between elbow-induced flow non-uniformity and the
volute tongue was indeed affecting acoustic output, at least regarding tonal
BPF noise, but also that more research was needed.
Other geometries of interest that have been tested in the literature are
tapered ducts [67, 41] and reservoirs [41]. As mentioned earlier, Lang
appreciated up to 15% improvement in surge margin optimizing reservoir
volume, a figure similar to that reported by Galindo et al. [67] regarding
improvement achieved by tapered ducts. Similarly, a convergent-divergent
nozzle was proposed by Desantes et al. [68], improving surge margin up to
25% at the cost of decreased maximum air flow. However, impact of these
solutions on noise output was not considered.
More sophisticated options to enhance surge margin have been also proposed. For instance, a large amount of authors have researched the use of
swirl generator devices placed upstream of the compressor inlet [69, 70].

The aforementioned work by Karim et al. [36] showed how a certain combination of swirl vanes could diminish overall SPL over the 6–12 kHz band.
Furthermore, Galindo et al. [62] considered both positive and negative
rotation devices, assessing their impact on surge margin and efficiency. Still,
acoustic output was not taken into account.
Addition of a ported shroud has also been reported as an effective method
of improving surge margin [28, 71]. In this solution, flow bleed slots are
introduced on the impeller wall, connecting with the compressor inlet. The
objective is that reversed flow should recirculate through these slots that
present lower pressures due to Venturi effect, instead of causing the usual
flow disturbance reversing across the tip clearance. At high mass flow, these
slots act as bypasses, improving choke limits.
Regarding the acoustical influence of these solutions, Chen and Yin [72]
evaluated the influence of different ported shroud geometrical aspects, including the effect of splitter blades on the compressor wheel. The authors
reported that full bladed compressors (as opposed of those with full and
splitter blades) equipped with a ported shroud exhibited a decrease in both
BPF (tonal) and overall noise.

2.5. Conclusions
After reviewing several works concerning diverse aspects of turbocharger
compressor noise generation, some general conclusions can be drawn about
the state of the art:
While axial compressors have been subject to aero-acoustical studies
since more than fifty years ago, noise generation in small centrifugal
compressors has been comparatively more scarce.
Several different methods for experimental acoustical characterization
of turbochargers can be found in the literature. Among others, variations include instrumentation, measured variables, sensor location,
etc.
Studies consistently identify two main acoustical phenomena types:
tonal noises related to a blade passing frequency (BPF) and its harmonics, and broadband noise at frequencies lower than BPF. The later
kind is usually linked to stalling blades and correspondent back flows,
but a clear mechanism is not yet firmly established.

Sometimes broadband noise at higher frequencies is ascribed to tip
clearance effects and referred to as TCN. Other authors refer to certain
broadband humps as “whoosh” noise, more related to unstable flow
in the inlet and being usually detected at lower frequencies, but other
authors do not distinguish between the two.
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations offer relevant insights about these stalling and recirculation issues, offering at the
same time the capacity of testing different geometries to mitigate
them. However, consistent and accurate prediction of measured noise
spectra is still difficult to achieve.
Characterization of the unstable flow phenomena in the compressor
inducer and inlet has been performed using temperature and pressure
indicators. More complete velocity field measurements using PIV are
usually performed compressors fitted with an open bell mouth, without
confining the reversed flow in a straight pipe.
Modification of compressor inlet geometry immediately upstream of
the compressor wheel has a demonstrated effect on surge margin and
compressor efficiency, but its influence on noise generation has been
scarcely analyzed.

CHAPTER 3

Noise measurement methodology
As stated in the prior chapter, one of the main objectives of the present work
has been to develop and implement robust measurement methodologies for
the acoustical characterization of turbocharger compressors.
In this chapter the theoretical background of these methodologies will be
presented, along with the details of their practical implementation and a
brief review of the facilities at where they have been implemented.
Apart from the purely experimental implementation, the step-by-step signal
processing required to produce final, compiled results will be introduced as
well, including sample results in order to illustrate each step.
Special care will be put in considering the different theoretical and practical
limitations and restrictions of experimental measurements and processing
techniques, to ensure that results are significant and robust.

3.1. Facilities
Most of the experimental work presented in this thesis has been carried
out at laboratory 5K of Universitat Politècnica de València. This facility is
equipped with two main installations.
The first one is a flow bench powered by a Diesel engine linked to an
asynchronous dyno and a screw compressor. This flow bench can be configured to function as a turbocharger test stand or to provide air flow to other
facilities. Subsection 3.1.1 will be dedicated to an extended description of
this installation.
Work on this chapter has been partly published in the following paper:

Next to the flow bench, there is a large anechoic chamber that can be
configured to either receive external air flow from the flow bench or to
host a standalone engine by itself. For this project, air was provided by
the flow bench when the turbocharger test stand was installed inside the
chamber. This arrangement is illustrated by Fig. 3.1, while subsection 3.1.2
will describe in detail this particular chamber.
Additionally, an engine test cell located on laboratory 6D has been used for
the on-engine validation tests described on chapter 5, where the inlet intake
of a commercial engine was modified to measure the compressor acoustic
emission.
Other facilities included an impulse test bench that was used for sensor calibration, and a workshop were the required customized parts for measuring
and instrumenting were manufactured.

3.1.1. Flow test rig
The flow test rig has been used as flow provider to power the turbocharger
turbine both directly, with the turbocharger installed in the flow rig cell itself
and, as shown in Fig. 3.1, with the turbocharger mounted in a supporting
frame inside the anechoic chamber.
At the core of the rig there is a heavy duty MIDR 06.20.45 Diesel engine able
to provide up to 260 kW of power. This engine is linked to an asynchronous
dyno and, through a coupling gear, to an Atlas Copco ZA 110-3.5 volumetric
screw compressor. An overview of the whole installation can be seen in Fig.
3.2.
Purpose of this compressor is twofold. First, it supercharges the Diesel
engine as its original turbocharger group was removed. Second, compressed
flow can be routed to either a turbocharger installed in the same cell or to
the adjacent chambers.
Another possibility of this test rig is to directly feed the exhaust gases of
the engine to an external turbocharger. This is the reason why the original
turbocharger was removed during installation. Direct flow will contain
the pulsating content of the engine, allowing simulation of real engine
conditions. The number of cylinders firing can be selected from 1 to 6 in

Figure 3.2: Render of the flow rig showing the engine core, asynchronous
dyno with its support cabinet, screw compressor and air distribution system,
including control valves and reservoirs.

order to simulate different pulsating content. Also, if the hot exhaust gas
is desired but the pulsations are not, flow can be routed through a settling
tank that will smooth them out, resulting in continuous flow.
For the studies carried out in this facility during the development of this
thesis, pulsating flow was not selected. Continuous flow was used in both
the test rig and the anechoic chamber. However, work presented in chapter 5
used real engine conditions to validate the proposed techniques and obtained
results.
As for the flow control, another reservoir equipped with a discharging
valve can be used to distribute the compressed air between the engine inlet
manifold and the external circuit, which can be either directed to another
chamber or vented to the outside ambient through a silencer.
If cold flow is desired, a water intercooler can be used to lower the temperature produced by the compression process. This temperature, along with
the rest of flow properties like mass flows, pressures and other temperatures,
are recorded through a dedicated control system.
Engine and brake are controlled though their own independent instrumentation, while the instantaneous turbocharger variables, including those
needed for acoustical characterization, are recorded through the dedicated
high speed Yokogawa DL716 DAQ system.

3.1.2. Anechoic chamber
The anechoic chamber at laboratory 5K is a solid 9.5 × 9 × 7.2 m reinforced
concrete structure, isolated from the rest of the building and resting on a
waterproof support that dampens outside vibrations.
The internal walls of the chamber are completely covered in fiberglass
wedges of 0.8 m of longitude and a square base of 0.2×0.2 m. These wedges
leave an interior space of 7.5 × 6.5 × 6 m. Usually a further 1 m in each
direction is left as an additional safety margin, the rest of the volume being
equivalent to acoustic free field conditions.
Such free field conditions, where no acoustic reflection of the walls occurs,
are certified in this chamber up to a cut-off frequency of 100 Hz. Low
frequency waves may start to reflect below this limit.
A lightweight, acoustically-transparent, grated metallic floor is situated
over the floor wedges, supporting personnel and light equipment. Four
round steel pillars affixed to the concrete floor are available to support heavy
loads such as engines.

Figure 3.3: View of the inside of the anechoic chamber, showing the turbocharger setup with the mounting frame and the pipes required to operate
the installation.

During the work described in this thesis, the load-bearing pillars were unused, since the turbocharger frame was lightweight enough to be supported
by the grated floor. Figure 3.3 shows the tested turbocharger installed in
this frame.
In order to allow the operation of the turbocharger, compressed air flow
is fed to the turbine from the flow rig described in the prior subsection.
The turbine discharges to a reservoir equipped with a conical nozzle that
decreases velocity and acoustic emissions.
Meanwhile, the compressor takes ambient air from the chamber, while its
exhaust is redirected to the adjacent auxiliary room for discharging, as seen
in Fig 3.1. A closed-loop lubricating oil system is also present. Water is also
provided to the cooling jackets of the sensors that require it, specially those
located on the turbine pipes and the compressor outlet.
A control system similar to that of the flow rig monitors the operation
of the system and gathers operational data (pipe temperatures, pressures,
mass flow, compressor speed, etc.), allowing regulation of oil temperature,
and compressor operation settings (speed and mass flow). Scientific data
(mainly dynamic pressure) is recorded with a Yokogawa DL716 DAQ system.

3.1.3. Engine test cell
As mentioned early in the chapter, while most of the experimental work
was carried out using the two facilities described already, the measurement
methodology was later put to the test on an engine test cell to verify its
reliability on real engine conditions.
The test cell is equipped with an asynchronous electromagnetic brake that
allows both steady and transient automatic testing. Operative parameters
and control for the engine and brake are integrated into a custom system,
including gravimetric fuel consumption sensors, hot plate anemometers,
emission measurements and temperature and pressure control of the air
pipes and coolant flows.
Access and online control of the engine ECU is also available, and a special
pneumatic system can be used to inject compressed air into the inlet manifold
downstream of the compressor.
This air injection reduces the air that the compressor ingests, thus lowering
compressor air flow and allowing the control of this relevant parameter
independently of the engine necessities. The system was used to bring the
compressor to surge and near-surge conditions during our research.
In order to implement and validate the in-duct acoustical measurement
methodology presented in this chapter, additional sensors and equipment
were fitted into the test cell, including a Yokogawa DL716 high speed DAQ
system and a Brüel & Kjær PULSETM DAQ system with a type 4197 pressurepressure sound intensity probe used as reference.

Figure 3.4: View of the inside of the engine test cell with the engine in its
default configuration, before being modified for the acoustic measurements
described in chapter 5.

3.2. Tested turbochargers
Different turbochargers have been used in the development of the investigation, as dictated by the requirements of the different projects and facilities
that this thesis comprises. All of them are however similar, small to medium
sized automotive turbochargers. The most relevant model is the Garrett
GT17 model that was used in chapters 3, 4, 6 and section 8.1.

development of the investigation, marking some relevant dimensions.

This particular model, featuring six main blades and six splitter blades,
was digitized to obtain its detailed geometry, which is shown in Fig. 3.5
along with its most relevant dimensions. A similar turbocharger was used
for engine tests on chapter 5 and section 8.2 and another for chapter 7 and
section 8.3, both modified in order to fit different inlet geometries.

3.3. In-duct noise measurement
In this section, a methodology is proposed to evaluate the noise emission of
the compressor through its inlet and outlet pipes across selected zones of
the compressor map of operating conditions. It allows a simple and clear
visualization of noise phenomena and their frequency distributions at all
possible operation points of the turbocharger system.

Although compressor manufacturers sometimes provide these kind of
“noise maps” [6], they usually refrain from providing an adequately referenced and step-by-step methodology to reproduce them.
Reviewing the existing literature on turbocompressor noise a variety of
very different measurement techniques can be found, from the two-sensor,
in-duct approach of Tiikoja et al [34] to simple single-sensor pressure levels
and external commercial noise-meters [29].
However, these works focus on the research of different phenomena (transmission loss [34], effect of flow incidence angle [29], sound generation by
rotating stall [15], source characterization [16], etc.), not on the acoustical
methodology itself nor on the particular setup considerations and restrictions
that each measurement technique imposes.
In this chapter these shortcomings in existing literature are addressed by
proposing a suitable experimental methodology and discussing the details of
its theoretical background, its implementation, restrictions and processing
required to produce useful results.

3.3.1. Theoretical background
The first step is thus to review the theoretical background of the determination of acoustic output in the specific situation of ducts with mean flow,
and decide techniques to experimentally obtain the required data for their
implementation.

3.3.1.1. Sound intensity in flow ducts
While it is possible [29] to rely on a single sensor to measure the scalar
sound pressure level (SPL) of the flow at a certain location of a duct, more
sophisticated approaches are needed to estimate the sound intensity level
(SIL) that is propagating through the duct.
It is important to consider that the scalar magnitude of sound pressure
level at a point can be influenced by the precise geometry of that section
and by nodes and reflections that may occur in the duct, whereas sound
intensity is a vectorial magnitude that remains almost constant along the
duct (except for small dissipation losses), making it a more robust indicator
of noise emission.

The basis of such intensity measurement methods is to consider that
the pressure signal x(t) measured at a given point of a duct is the linear
superposition of a pressure wave x + travelling downstream and another
pressure wave x − travelling upstream (sometimes referred to as forward
and backward waves, respectively [73]) so that:
x(t) = x + (t) + x − (t)

(3.3.1)

Comparing the pressure information at two or more spatial positions it is
thus possible to infer how the waves are propagating along the duct in each
direction, a possibility unavailable by means of a single sensor.
When using this wave decomposition approach, the sound intensity can be
estimated following the expression proposed by Morfey [74] and successfully
derived by Dokumaci [75] from physical principles:

Here X+ and X− are, respectively, the complex spectra of the downstream
and upstream pressure waves, ρ is the mean density, a the mean sound
speed, and M the mean Mach number of the flow.

3.3.1.2. Beamforming wave decomposition
For a more intuitive comprehension of the beamformer, one can consider its
transmitting equivalent: a phased array emitter where the same signal x(t),
with its phase shifted by a quantity w∗n , is fed to an n-element linear array of
fixed transmitters, forming a plane wave emitted in the θ direction which
can be steered at will adjusting each w∗n . The beamforming method provides
a way to mathematically tune the sensitivity of the overall system in order
to isolate the downstream and upstream information of the acquired signal.
A scheme for a narrowband beamformer can be found in Fig. 3.6.
The approach in this caase is the inverse: by tuning the weights w∗n that
multiply each recorded pressure signal x n (t) the pressure wave coming from
the direction of arrival (DOA) θ that we are interested in may be resolved.
Details can be found in [76].
The extension to a wideband beamformer is relatively straightforward
[77]. First the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT, denoted by ) of the recorded
pressure signals is computed:
Xn ( f k ) =

{x n (t k )}

(3.3.3)

Subscript k indicates that the signal is acquired at discrete time steps.
The described narrowband procedure is then followed for each discrete
frequency to finally obtain the desired signal through the inverse transform:
x(t) =

−1

wH ( f k ) X( f k )

(3.3.4)

Here, X( f k ) is the k × n matrix of transformed signals and wH ( f k ) is the
matrix of weights for each frequency. In order to compute the optimal
weights for the desired DOAs (θ = −90o for downstream and θ = 90o for
upstream waves, assuming a typical flow DOA of θ = 90o ), several schemes
can be used.
For this study a Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance (LCMV) beamformer was used, a well established procedure, which aims at minimizing
the overall output power (variance) of the signal, while maintaining unitary
gain in the precise desired direction.
While several beamforming strategies and implementations are available,
3.5.1 offers a simple guide on how to compute wH ( f k ) and thus X+ and X−
using this particular approach. Figure 3.7 shows the result of this decomposition in the time domain.
Further information on its application, including a comparison of various
of these schemes against simulated and experimental data is available in the
work of Piñero et al. [73].

3.3.2. Experimental procedure
Once that a suitable in-duct noise measurement technique was selected, it is
necessary to analyze how to implement the procedure in the experimental
setup, perform the measurements, and process the resulting data.

3.3.2.1. Turbocharger instrumentation
The correct design and installation of the fast pressure sensor arrays is a
critical part of the experimental setup.
Ideally, the sensors should be mounted flush (with water-cooled adapters
if necessary) in straight pipes, with diameters adjusted to preserve the cross
sectional area of the adjacent duct in order to avoid complex structures
caused by singularities.

160 krpm and 60 g/s), including frequency limitations described in equations
3.3.6 and 3.3.7. The characteristic blade pass frequency can also be identified,
specially in the outlet spectra.

As a further measure, enough straight clearance should be left before and
after the array (as shown on figure 3.9), to ensure essentially plane wave
flow at the measurement section [78]. There should be a minimum of 6
diameters upstream of the array and a further 4 diameters downstream, as
recommended in [79].

When placing the transducers, it is important that the 1/5 and 1/3 nodes of
the established standing wave pattern are avoided [80]. Also, a compromise
in the spacing ds between them must be reached, taking into consideration
errors in the low-frequency [81] and high-frequency [82] bands.
Specially, it should be noted that spatial aliasing effects will occur above
the Nyquist frequency imposed by the spacing ds . The time of arrival of
a wave with DOA θ and speed a to two consecutive sensors spaced by a
distance ds is:
ds sin θ
(3.3.5)

This imposes a Nyquist-type frequency criterion, as the measured wave
frequency f n should be maximum half the frequency f d = 1/Td naturally
associated with Td to ensure that no high frequency spatial aliasing effects
are present:

A further restricting phenomenon is the acoustic mode propagation. As

3D effects.

Figure 3.9: Scheme of the proposed turbocharger instrumentation setup, highlighting in color the three-sensor beamforming arrays and their clearance
requirements.

According to Eriksson [83], it may be assumed that waves in a circular
duct propagate in a planar fashion (i.e., pressure is constant in every crosssectional area of the duct) below a cut-off frequency of:
f a = 1.84

a
πD

1 − M2

(3.3.7)

Here, a is the sound speed, D the duct diameter and M the mean Mach
number. At higher frequencies, the so-called first asymmetric mode will start
to propagate, thus rendering the assumption of one-dimensional propagation
invalid. The first circular mode will in turn propagate beyond a cut-off
frequency of:
a
f c = 3.83
1 − M2
(3.3.8)
πD
Special care should be taken when computing limiting frequencies f n , f a
as they are not constant but dependent on the operating condition, since
some of their components vary with temperature and mass flow. Figure 3.8
shows both limits for a certain operating point.
As the figure shows, the Nyquist criterion accurately pinpoints where differences between sensors start to grow, and it is clearly a more restrictive
criterion than the acoustic mode onset. This limit should be properly computed for each condition when multi-sensor decomposition techniques are
used.
Also, figure 3.8 shows other phenomena, for instance the Blade Passing
Frequency (BPF) tonal noise that is identified in many of the works presented
in chapter 2. As shown in table 2.2, the main BPF can be estimated by taking
into account the shaft speed and the number of main blades:
BPF ∼ 160 krpm / 60

s
× 6 main blades ∼ 16 kHz
min

(3.3.9)

It is also important to note that the closer the sensors are mounted together
for increasing the f n limit, the poorer the spatial resolution of low frequency
waves will be, as the wavelengths λ = a/ f become too long and the difference between consecutive sensors decreases below the noise threshold. This
effect is intrinsically related to each particular sensor model, but it must be
considered if very low frequencies are of interest.
Finally, it is essential to ensure that the response of the three sensors of
each array is coherent. Before mounting the sensors in the final linear array
form, they should be mounted radially in the same section of a duct and
individually calibrated, to ensure that the difference between sensors is not
due to individual transducer differences, but only to wave propagation.

Figure 3.10: Results of the calibration of the outlet sensors in an impulse
test rig, showing a pressure measurement match in both time and frequency
domains.

In this case, the calibration is performed in an impulse test rig (described in
detail in [84]) so as to obtain a clear reference pressure wave in all sensors.
Both the time and frequency responses are observed, and both the amplifier
offset and gain are adjusted to find the best match. An example can be seen
on figure 3.10.
In addition to the fast pressure sensors data, more information is required
to compile the compressor operating conditions map. These maps are usually
presented as plots of the operation points on a total-to-total pressure ratio

3.3.2.2. Steady state measurements
The usual approach for measuring the operating points of the compressor
map involves reducing the air flow by progressively closing the back-pressure
valve (shown in figure 3.9) until the desired air mass flow is reached, while
the turbine power is adjusted to preserve a given corrected compressor speed
(N ∗ ) and to achieve stable operation conditions.
Eventually the compressor blades will begin to stall, until a deep surge
condition is reached, as shown in the top plot of figure 3.11. In order to
avoid this destructive condition, the valve will be opened again and another
constant corrected regime line will be measured, until the desired region of
the compressor map is completely covered.
Several reference conditions can be selected when correcting the speed
and the air mass flow; in this study the mean sea level standard day (defined
as one of 15ºC of temperature and 1 atm of pressure) of the International
Standard Atmosphere will be used:

3.3.2.3. Surge limit characterization
When measuring a turbocharger operation map, it is particularly important to characterize accurately the surge limit, especially when an acoustic
evaluation is sought out [85].

including the precise determination of the deep surge limit: top plot on the
left shows the temporal evolution of the raw relative pressure recorded by one
piezoelectric sensor; bottom plot on the left depicts the correlation between
the frequency content in the 0-20 Hz band and deep surge onset.

In order to measure different mass flows, the back-pressure valve is usually
closed slowly until a certain surge criterion is met, and then opened to
avoid damaging the turbocharger. Several surge criteria for centrifugal
turbomachinery have been proposed in the literature, for tests on flow
benches [85] and on engine test rigs [61].
An average of power spectrum of a single pressure sensor in the 0 to 20
Hz range, shown by Galindo et al [85] to be a good surge indicator, was
computed once for discrete time steps k of 0.5 seconds, providing a clear
indication of deep surge onset, as marked in figure 3.11 (top) with a solid
line.
Xk = | {x(t)}|2 , t ∈ [t k , t k+1 ]

(3.3.12)

To obtain the required near-surge data points to be displayed on the map,
represented by in the bottom plot of figure 3.11, a 1 second average of
all recorded data was computed 1 second before surge as indicated by the
dashed lines of the left plot, in order to calculate the map coordinates of the
point.

3.3.2.4. Signal postprocessing: maps and spectrograms
In addition to the intensity spectra determined for each operating point,
further results can be obtained by applying an interpolation procedure to
the spectra associated with all the points tested.
For instance, it is possible to calculate the overall level of sound intensity
for a given frequency range at each operating point i of the compressor
operating map. The sound intensity level at a characteristic band (between
f1 and f2 ) can be calculated for each point as:
f2

L i = 10 log10 1012

I( f )

(3.3.13)

f = f1

Once that several L i levels have been measured for different conditions of
a selected map region, a cubic spline interpolation function Φ f1 − f2 is used to
project the data onto a much more fine and regularly spaced grid, allowing
the representation of a map of noise intensity across the measured region of
the compressor map, as shown in figure 3.12.
These “noise maps” synthesize the information of the acoustic output of a
frequency band of interest in a simple and visual result, allowing an easy
estimation of the noise emission through desired operating conditions even
if these have not been specifically measured.

the processing described in subsection 3.3.2.4, including the measured data
points (◦) and the paths later expanded as spectrograms shown in figure 3.13.
The left hand side map represents the inlet duct, whereas the right hand side
map represents the outlet duct.

Expanding on the necessity of analysing the frequency content evolution
as the operating conditions of the compressor change, a different approach
can be used, where the measured discrete information can be compiled to
estimate a continuous spectrogram.
This is accomplished by sequentially performing the previous map processing for a number N of much smaller frequency bands of width ∆ f , resulting
in a collection of N interpolation functions Φ f j − f j+1 , where f j+1 − f j = ∆ f .
Using these functions, the intensity levels L on each small frequency band
k are interpolated for a set of M pairs of the compressor map coordinates,
such that:
L j = Φ f j − f j+1 (m
˙ ∗ , ΠTT )

(3.3.14)

An estimation of the spectrogram S that would be obtained in a quasistationary measurement by following the set of operation conditions (m
˙ ∗ , ΠTT )
pairs can then be compiled gathering the levels L j . Choosing one coordinate

3.3.3. Sample results
[Quitar?]
In order to illustrate the methodology presented in this section, a measurement of the tested turbocharger was first carried out in the flow bench
that is used to provide flow to the anechoic chamber, configured as shown
in figure 3.9. Since in this case the only concern was the validation of the
in-duct methodology, installation in the anechoic was not required.
Kistler type 7031 piezoelectric transducers were used for the inlet duct;
the outlet duct was fit with type 6031 transducers due to available stock.

was selected, allowing for a safe upper limit in terms of the spatial Nyquist
criterion f n of ∼6000 and ∼3500 Hz respectively (precise values depend on
the conditions of each point).
The variables needed in order to characterize the map point (mass flow,
speed, temperatures and pressures) were averaged during 30 seconds using
the in-house DAQ system, while the six piezoelectric sensors acquired 105
pressure samples during 1 second using a Yokogawa digital recorder.
Pressure signals on recorded points (shown in figure 3.11) were then
processed according to the proposed methodology. Samples of the final
results are presented in figures 3.12 and 3.13.
Figure 3.12 shows the 1 – 3 kHz sound intensity level distribution across
selected operating conditions, approximately between maximum efficiency
and the measured surge limit. As shown in chapter 2, noise in this supersynchronous frequency is often known as “whoosh”.

Another point of concern that has been identified in the results is that the
relevance of this particular phenomenon extends far from the surge region
and well into the expected engine operation region.
Looking at either the 160 krpm line on figure 3.12 or at the expanded
spectrograms of this line in figure 3.13 where this band has been marked,
there is a local maximum in this band between 60 and 70 g/s. For the 180
krpm points on the map of figure 3.12, the “whoosh” noise may be heard
even for up to 80 g/s mass flow rate.
Apart from “whoosh”, both spectrograms show a clear rise in low frequency
content when the mass flow is reduced and surge conditions start to appear,
even if deep surge conditions have not yet been reached. This is consistent
with spectrograms measured experimentally by Galindo et al [86].

3.4. External noise measurements
While the accurate characterization of the internal sound field is crucial to
understand the different phenomena, the transmission of the noise to the
ambient is also relevant as external acoustic radiation is ultimately the main
concern of the automotive industry.
To that extent, different external measurements have been carried out as
part of the experimental campaign. Noise data has been captured in the
orifice of the compressor inlet, around the far field of the turbocharger, and
along the radiating surfaces near field.
This section will describe how these measurement were made, while results
and discussion will be presented in section 4.2 of chapter 4, including a
correlation of orifice noise and in-duct results and the discussion on the
contribution to the overall noise produced by each part of the system.

3.4.1. Orifice noise
The noise emitted by the open end of the compressor inlet duct is of special
concern, as it is the point where the internal sound field meets the exterior
ambient. Furthermore, the compressor may not act as the only source of
noise in this case, as the noise produced by the flow interaction with the
duct orifice during the aspiration process can be relevant as well.
However, when measuring external noise care should be taken to avoid
reflections and perturbations that may interfere with the results. This is why
it was decided to install the turbocharger inside the anechoic chamber, so that
free-field conditions could be recreated and external noise measurements
could be taken and compared against in-duct results.

In this chamber, instrumentation consisted of two
Brüel & Kjær type 4190 free-field microphones,
fitted with type 2669C pre-amplifiers and placed next
to the compressor inlet orifice, separated 10 cm and
20 cm, respectively. These are shown as “Mic 1” and
“Mic 2” in Fig. 3.14.
These microphones were calibrated before the measurements with a Brüel & Kjær type 4228 pistonphone. Both the calibration and the data acquisition
were performed with a Brüel & Kjær PULSE system.
As the conditions inside the anechoic chamber can
be regarded as being equivalent to those of an acoustic free field, we can estimate the magnitude of the
sound intensity at each microphone i as:

from pressure and temperature sensors available in
the anechoic chamber.

3.4.2. Far field
Taking advantage of the free-field conditions of the chamber, additional
microphones were installed around the turbocharger group to estimate the
far field sound radiation, in a manner similar of the setup used by Teng and
Homco [10] for engine measurements.
To obtain a better estimation of the sound field, four free-field microphones
of the same type 4190 were distributed around the the central point of the
installation, at a radial distance of 1 m from it, as Fig. 3.15 shows.
Data from all microphones was captured using a Brüel & Kjær PULSETM
DAQ system, composed by types 3560 D, 7536, 2826 and 2 × 3032A (hardware) and types 7700, 7702, 7705 and 7755 B (software). In order to
provide a global metric to compare against orifice noise, results for the four
far-field microphones were averaged to compute the overall sound pressure
level radiated by the turbocharger system.

3.4.3. Near field
While useful to characterize the far field sound information emitted by
the turbocharger, successful measurement through free-field microphones
depend on the acoustic characteristics of the test ambient being suitable.
As standard turbocharger test rigs and engine test cells are usually not
acoustically conditioned, reflections and interferences make measurements
of external noise difficult.
These issues increase when the objective is to analyze the acoustic field
near the tested turbochargers, as near-field measurements can be adversely
impacted by diffuse background noise and reactive sound fields [87, 88].
A technique that could be useful in order to address these issues is the direct
measurement of acoustic particle velocity level (PVL). A probe featuring a
MEMS sensor1 enabling these kind of measurements in air has been made
commercially available by Microflown [89].
This probe has been used to perform acoustic intensity measurements,
demonstrating some advantages against pressure-based probes [90]. Applications include acoustic holography for near-field situations [91] and

panel-based noise evaluation in automotive cabins [92]. In chapter 5 one
of these probes will be used to perform a test in a standard engine cell in
order to assess its usefulness in identifying the near-field acoustic signature
generated by the turbocharger.

3.5. Conclusions
In this chapter a detailed experimental methodology for the noise evaluation
of turbocharger compressors in flow benches or engine test cells has been
proposed. It includes a description of the kind of turbochargers tested in this
thesis and the facilities where the experimental work has been developed.
The characterization method is based on a robust in-duct acoustical beamforming technique that resolves the plane wave range sound intensity, by
decomposing the total pressure signal into its upstream and downstream
components.
In addition to resolving intensity, another advantage of the wave decomposition technique is the possibility of isolating the pressure data coming
from the compressor, in order to enhance the spectral content of interest
in situations where actual anechoic setups are not feasible, due to valves,
filters, and other elements.
This isolated pressure information is also useful to validate or initialize
CFD simulations where the model boundary conditions have to be defined
as anechoic because simulating accessories (valves, flexible ducts, etc.) is
not worthy or desirable. Such a validation methodology was presented in
[1] and is discussed in chapter 6 of this work.
When used to evaluate the acoustic intensity of the noise generated by
the compressor, the proposed signal processing allows to easily understand
visual representations in the form of noise maps of selected frequency bands
of interest and estimated spectrograms of operating paths. This can provide
guidelines for the evaluation of strategies to counter or avoid certain adverse
noise phenomena.
The examples presented above illustrate how this technique allows detecting known acoustical phenomena of a centrifugal compressor, such as
medium frequency “whoosh noise” and low frequency surge onset, as well as
mapping its distribution and relevance across different operating conditions
of the turbocharger.

In addition to offering the detailed measurement and signal processing
steps, this chapter stresses the importance of taking into account restrictive
factors such as calibration, sensor setup clearances and locations, frequency
aliasing effects and ranges in which theoretical assumptions hold in order
to obtain robust and reproducible results.
Additionally, and taking advantage of the anechoic chamber where the
turbocharger was installed, instrumentation added to measure external
noise (both orifice noise and the noise radiated to the far field by the system
surfaces) is described. Finally, the application of an acoustic particle velocity probe to measure the near-field emission of a turbocharger in engine
conditions is proposed.

3.5.1. Appendix: LCMV beamforming procedure
[Donde poner esto? O quitarlo?]
This appendix proposes a step by step guide to compute the desired X+
and X− decomposed pressure spectra required in equation 3.3.2, using a
LCMV (Linearly Restricted Minimum Covariance) strategy as presented by
Verdú [93].
Recall that decomposed signals for each frequency f k are obtained by
weighting the transformed measurement matrix X( f k ) = [X 1 X 2 X 3 ] = {[x 1 x 2 x 3 ]}
as follows:
X+ ( f k ) = w+ X( f k )

Where g + = [1 0] T and g − = [0 1] T are the desired response vectors
(unitary gain in one direction and zero gain in the opposite). Σ x denotes the
covariance matrix. For a certain discrete frequency f k , using the expected
value E:
Σ x ( f k ) = E[X( f k ) XH ( f k )]
(3.5.5)

The constraints matrix A(Θ) = [a+ (θ ) a− (θ )] T contains the beamformer
response array (signal lags) in both directions:
a+ (θ ) = a(−90◦ ) = 1, exp( jβ + ds ), exp( jβ + 2ds )

CHAPTER 4

Noise measurement results
“Take care of the sense, and the sounds will
take care of themselves.”

Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland.

In this chapter, the results of applying the described acoustic measurement
methodology to the turbochargers considered in this investigation will be
presented and analyzed. A first section of the chapter will deal with the
in-duct results, both regarding the full spectrum of the turbocharger noise
output and the plane wave frequency range, which will be analyzed in detail
with the help of the wave decomposition technique to calculate the sound
intensity.
Externally radiated noise produced by the turbocharger group will be also
discussed, the results comprising both inlet orifice noise and the radiation
around the system generated by the turbocharger itself and its inlet and
outlet ducts. Additionally, a correlation will be obtained between the internal
and orifice noise levels, that could be useful to estimate the external noise
levels without the need to test the system in a large anechoic environment.

4.1. Internal noise field
The first part of the experimental campaign consisted of gathering sufficient
acoustic data across several operating conditions of the compressor, in order
to compute not only the acoustic signature in the most typical points but
also how this signature varied at different conditions.
Work on this chapter has been partly published in the following paper:

Figure 4.1: Comparison of the compressor map provided by the manufacturer
and the critical operating points measured in the experimental campaign,
including the deep surge limit measured in the gas stand, the approximate
working line with the target engine and the 160 krpm speed line.

Data for this in-duct noise analysis was recorded using the previously
described piezoelectric sensor arrays in both inlet and outlet ducts. This
data was then processed in the form of pressure and sound intensity and
pressure spectra, noise maps, and spectrograms to show different aspects
of the turbocharger acoustic behaviour and its evolution across different
operating conditions.
These operating conditions at which measurements were performed were
selected taking into account the full compressor map provided by the manufacturer and the approximate working line1 of the engine operating points
in real-life conditions and the capabilities of the compressor test bench.

1

Note that at shaft speeds grater than 190 krpm a second turbocharger is activated in
this engine, creating a shift in the working line noticeable in the range between 2.5 and 3
pressure ratio.

Regarding air mass flow, conditions were measured from approximately
the maximum efficiency point to a limit slightly beyond the conservative deep
surge line indicated by the manufacturer. Pressure ratios were measured
up to the maximum capability of the available screw compressor to provide
continuous flow.
The two limits conform a measurement subset of the compressor map
depicted in Fig. 4.1 in color. This subset encompasses the working line up to
a shaft speed of 170 krpm. In addition, the deep surge limit was measured
in a separate gas stand to locate more accurately the true limit.
These surge measurements were performed with a tapered duct in the
compressor inlet line to match the gas stand pipe diameter, which has
an influence on the surge margin. Although, these tests confirmed that
the manufacturer margin was close enough to the deep surge measured
according to the methodology of low frequency content increase described
in chapter 3.
As it can be seen in Fig. 4.1 for most of the measured shaft speed lines the
last data point (the one with less air mass flow) was situated approximately
in between the conservative limit established by the manufacturer and the
limit experimentally measurable in the gas stand.
This allowed the comparison between optimum compressor operating
points situated at near the maximum thermodynamic efficiency conditions
and the most critical conditions near deep surge, passing through the unstable mild surge (or marginal surge) region between the two extremes.

4.1.1. Spectral content
Inlet and outlet pressure spectra were measured at each one of the selected
points, allowing a comparison in terms of frequency content of the pressure
signals and distribution of acoustic intensity across the measured compressor
map. In this subsection results will be divided between plane wave frequency
range, where the wave decomposition algorithm based on beamforming can
be applied to the array signals to compute the forward and backward waves,
and the higher frequencies where acoustic modes are present and thus the
decomposition cannot be performed.
To provide a better insight on how the spectral content of the pressure
signals changes across the different operating conditions two subsets of the
measured map have been highlighted.

The first of these subsets is a constant shaft speed line at 160 krpm where
the air mass flow is progressively reduced from approximately highest efficiency. This will allow the analysis of how the spectral content changes with
mass flow from relatively stable conditions to unstable ones.
A second subset forms a distribution of data points following the working
line of the real engine which is depicted in Fig. 4.1. Since this line is situated
at an approximately constant distance from the surge limit it allows to track
the evolution of spectral content given by the change in shaft speed while
keeping similarly mild surge operating conditions.

4.1.1.1. Plane wave range
Though dependent on pipe diameter, flow temperature and velocity, typical
automotive turbocharger compressor setups can maintain plane wave conditions up to 5–7 kHz [6]. It is specially relevant because it comprises the
frequencies of relevant acoustic phenomena such as “whoosh” noise, tonal
noise induced by BPF harmonics, deep surge, etc.
From the research point of view, this frequency range is interesting because
considering the pressure change constant along each pipe section allows for
easier analytical and numerical modelling.
Working in this range allows the use of wave decomposition procedures
to isolate the contributions coming forward or backward through the compressor inlet and outlet pipes. These decomposed pressure waves can also
be used together to compute the acoustic intensity through the duct.
From chapter 3 it can be recalled that in a circular duct with mean flow, the
cut-off frequency at which the plane wave assumption cannot be considered
to be valid any longer is given by equation 3.3.7. At higher frequencies, the
first asymmetric acoustic mode starts propagating.
In the case of the pipes considered in this study, evaluation of this expression led to cut-off frequencies of approximately 4.7 kHz for the inlet duct
and 7.4 kHz in the case of the outlet duct, due to differences in flow conditions and pipe diameter. Also, it must be taken into account that this limit
varied slightly because of changes in velocity and temperature at different
operating conditions.
However, the spatial Nyquist-like criterion related to the separation of the
sensors of the decomposition array described by equation 3.3.6 was more
restrictive than the asymmetric mode limit, leading to cut-off frequencies
for plane wave decomposition to 3.4 kHz for the inlet and 6.4 kHz for the
outlet.

In Fig. 4.2 the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the raw pressure signals
captured by one piezoelectric sensor of each array is shown. For both
inlet and outlet ducts, spectra are plotted at different shaft speeds along
the working line depicted in Fig. 4.1. It can be seen in this figure how,
generally, spectra on the plane wave range feature higher levels at lower
frequencies. Higher speed points in the outlet feature a distinctive subsynchronous broadband between 1 and 2.5 kHz, described as whoosh noise
in the literature.
In Fig. 4.3 the same procedure has been carried out for the 160 krpm shaft
speed line marked with a dashed line in Fig. 4.1, in order to evaluate the
evolution of spectral content as air mass flow is reduced through the mild

surge conditions. In the outlet where the whoosh phenomenon can be seen
between 1 kHz or less and up to 3 kHz with greater clarity. Again, spectral
content below approximately 3 kHz appear more “jagged” that at higher
frequencies.
It is also apparent, specially examining the spectra at 60 g/s and 55 g/s
that the broadband is not so apparent at the lowest flow conditions not
because it decreases in level but because of the increase in the surrounding
frequency content that matches the broadband level, thereby masking it.

Moreover, it should be remarked that this broadband phenomena at typical
“whoosh” noise frequencies can be identified even at the operating point
with higher air mass flow, which is located near the maximum efficiency
region of the compressor map; a zone which is presumed to be stable.

4.1.1.2. Decomposed pressure waves
In order to better isolate the spectral content coming from the compressor
from the reflections and interferences of the upstream and downstream
ducting and components, the wave decomposition algorithm based on LCMV
beamforming presented in chapter 3 was applied to the aforementioned pressure data recorded by the three-sensor arrays while following the working
line and 160 krpm line operating conditions.
The differences in spectral content between the decomposed pressure
waves and the reconstructed total pressure signal can be seen in Fig. 4.4
where the three are plotted for two opposite operating conditions: higher
flow at lower speed and lower flow at higher speed.
It can be seen how, as previously mentioned, the decomposed signal coming
from the compressor (backward wave in the inlet, forward wave in the outlet)
are almost coincident with the total pressure spectra along the plane wave
range, smoothing out the buzz-saw noise at the lower frequencies.

Figure 4.5: Comparison of decomposed pressure spectra along the working
line plotted in Fig. 4.1 for both the inlet duct (top plot, backwards travelling

Fig. 4.5 shows the PSD of this decomposed pressure signal. In the case
of the top plot that contains the information from the inlet duct, PSD from
the backward travelling wave is presented, since it is the one coming from
the compressor. Conversely, the forward travelling wave PSD is plotted in
the case of the bottom plot depicting outlet duct data. Note the spurious
aliasing peaks as the spatial Nyquist limit is reached.

It can thus be seen in Fig. 4.5 that the decomposition algorithm allows a
clearer representation of the signal, since it is not affected by the buzz-saw
effect at lower frequencies (lower than 3 kHz), specially visible in the inlet
spectra (see also Fig. 4.4 for a comparison).

A similar result can be seen in Fig. 4.6, where the decomposed pressure
waves are plotted for the data points in the 160 krpm, from higher to lower
air mass flows. It shows a clear identification of the “whoosh” broadband
phenomenon between 1 kHz and 3 kHz and how it becomes masked by the
rise in lower and higher content as air mass flow diminishes. A rotation
order tone at 160 krpm/60 s = 2.66 kHz is also noticeable in both ducts.

4.1.1.3. Higher frequencies
Beyond the previously mentioned cut-off frequencies, the propagation of
acoustic modes invalidates the plane wave assumption that it is made in the
wave decomposition process, thereby rendering this treatment unusable. It
is however interesting to consider at least the raw pressure PSD as it contains
relevant acoustic content.
In Fig. 4.7 the PSD of the pressure signals recorded by one sensor of the
array is presented, for both inlet and outlet ducts. It can be seen how, in
the case of the inlet pressure spectra, amplitude increases with shaft speed

elevation that starts at 12 kHz and collapses with plane wave propagation
at 5 kHz, which could be related to the TCN mentioned in the literature as
described in chapter 2.
Characteristic Blade Passing Frequency (BPF) peaks associated with each
shaft speed are also visible in the inlet spectra, although only for some speeds
such as 160 krpm or 170 krpm.

Evolution of the spectral content in the outlet pressure signal shows also
the previously discussed increase at plane wave frequencies, followed by a
broadband at higher frequencies which again could be related to the so-called
TCN. BPF peaks including some harmonics are visible in the outlet spectra,
even for conditions where they were not apparent in the inlet spectra.
Similar evolution can be observed in Fig. 4.8 which tracks the spectral
content of the raw pressure signal along the 160 krpm shaft speed line.
Again, BPF peaks are much more visible in the outlet spectra. The plane
wave broadband between is also noticeable in the outlet, along with other
higher frequency broadbands after the first mode cut-off frequency.

4.1.2. Non-dimensional analysis
Further insight into the spectral content of the signal can be obtained through
the use of non-dimensional analysis in order to identify the possible sources
or mechanisms behind certain features of the spectra, as done by numerous
authors such as Choi [17, 18], Mongeau [15, 16], Wolfram [20, 19] and
Carolus [21] regarding specially the development of similarity laws for
centrifugal pumps and fans [94].
In this way, non-dimensional power spectral density of the pressure signal
S( f ) can be written [15, 17] as being the product of two functions:
S( f )
2
ρVtip

D/Vtip

= G(H e, ϕ) · F (S t, ϕ)

(4.1.1)

On the left hand side, ρ is the mean density of the flow, D is the outer
diameter of the rotor and Vtip is the velocity of the blade tips. On the right
hand side, G(H e, ϕ) is an acoustic frequency response function that depends
on the Helmholtz number and comprises the influence of propagation effects
such as duct resonances and directivity [15, 20].
The source spectral distribution F (S t, ϕ) depends on the Strouhal number
and comprises the phenomena related to flow-induced acoustic generation
such as flow fluctuations and near field acoustic interactions [16].
Both functions depend of the operating conditions of the system, as remarked by their dependence on the flow coefficient ϕ. They are however
assumed to be independent of Re (Reynolds number). Definitions of the
non-dimensional parameters can be found in table 4.1.
Two Strouhal numbers have been considered: one is related to the tip
speed Vtip and is adjusted so that the blade passing frequency (BPF) has
S t = 1. The other takes into account the mean flow velocity U. Finally, the

Figure 4.10: Relationship of decomposed non-dimensional spectral density
(NSD) in the plane wave range (left) and higher frequency spectra (right)
with selected non-dimensional numbers for the different operating conditions
of the engine working line.

It can be seen in Fig. 4.9 how when the spectra Strouhal number that
takes into account the mean flow velocity S t(U) is used to normalize the
spectra, the “whoosh” hump appears to align between 1 and 3. Broadband
features at higher frequencies (right plots) however do not align.
However, when the Strouhal number takes into account the blade passing
frequency these high frequency features appear more aligned, specially the
tonal noise at the BPF and its harmonic at S t(Vtip ) = 1 and 2.

Helmholtz normalization appears to be quite similar, with the difference
that in this case the BPF tones are not aligned. by inspecting the decomposed
spectra on the left however, it can be seen that the spurious peak that limits
the range of valid beamforming decomposition is aligned as the spatial
Nyquist criterion depends on the speed of sound.
In Fig. 4.10 a similar analysis is carried out considering the spectral
information along the working line instead of along a fixed shaft speed.
In this case the the results are similar, although in this case the Strouhal
normalization that takes into account the tip velocity is more meaningful,
as different shaft speeds are considered.
Again, the broadband hump in the plane wave range that is typically
identified with “whoosh” appears to collapse when considering the mean
flow Strouhal, albeit in this figure tracking of this effect is more complicated
due to the simultaneous change in both shaft speed and mass flow rate.
In the case of the non-decomposed spectral information, it can be seen how
the higher frequency TCN-like broadband is now only collapsing when the
Helmholtz normalization is performed, whereas for both Strouhal normalizations clear differences can be seen between lower and higher shaft speeds.
This could point to this broadband frequency being highly influenced by the
speed of sound rather than by the flow mechanisms.

4.1.3. Interpolation
As described in section 3.3.2.4, the information contained in the discrete data
points measured in this experimental campaign can be used to interpolate
the results across the selected relevant section of the compressor map. This
allows a clearer understanding into how the noise content varies across the
different operating conditions of air mass flow and shaft speed.

4.1.3.1. Noise maps
In order to paint a general picture of the global sound emission of the
compressor across the selected operating range, in-duct sound intensity has

Figure 4.12: In-duct Sound intensity Level maps for inlet (top) and outlet

procedure.

For instance, Fig. 4.11 shows global in-duct Sound Intensity Level (SIL)
contours for both inlet and outlet in the frequency range where the plane
wave assumption holds true for both ducts ( f < 3400 Hz).
It can be seen that, as previously observed when analysing the pressure
spectra, sound intensity levels are generally higher in the outlet duct than
in the inlet duct as pressure fluctuations are amplified.

Distribution of SIL across the different conditions of the compressor map
holds some similarities between both ducts, with SIL increasing towards
the surge limit and with higher shaft speeds. However, the outlet seems
to feature an abrupt increase in levels at the lower allowable air mass flow
conditions, whereas the increase in the case of the inlet appears smoother.

Figure 4.14: In-duct Sound Pressure Level maps for inlet (left) and outlet
(right) ducts between 5 and 21 kHz Hz, obtained through the interpolation
procedure and considering the three sensors.

In order to provide a better insight into how frequency content is distributed across the compressor map, Fig. 4.12 shows sound intensity levels
at very low frequency, between 10 and 100 Hz.

Comparing Fig. 4.12 with 4.11 it can be observed how, in the case of the
inlet in-duct intensity, very low frequency content increase is parallel to the
surge limit line, thus making the slope of the contours different in the two
figures.
On the other hand, outlet intensity distribution is very similar between
the two figures, highlighting the importance of the contribution of the low
frequency content to the whole plane wave range.
In order to analyze the distribution of “whoosh” noise which, albeit still in
the plane wave range, does not comprise so low frequency content, maps
for intensity between 1 and 3 kHz have been plotted in Fig. 4.13.
Differences in the outlet in-duct SIL between between this range and those
shown previously in Figs 4.12 and 4.11 are noticeable. The slope of the SIL
contours has changed, showing that the increase in this frequency band is
more gradual with shaft speed, whereas in the two previous figures it rose
abruptly for the 160 krpm line marked in the plots with dashes.
Finally, data from higher frequencies (above plane wave range) has been
plotted in Fig. 4.14, showing the differences between the pressure levels
recorded by each one of the three sensors of the arrays. This data shows a
different pattern in the inlet duct: while still increasing with shaft speed,
highest levels are located at medium mass flow settings, not at the lower
ones.
As for the outlet, there are again differences when comparing against
previously shown distributions in the plane wave range. In this higher
frequency case, while content increases again with shaft speed, the point at
which the maximum is located varies with mass flow rate.
It can also be seen that in the case of the outlet, there are more differences
between the spectral content recorded by each of the sensors of the array
that in the case of the inlet where differences are much more difficult to
appreciate. This is probably due the flow presentation being much more
uniform in the inlet as it is coming from the ambient, while in the case of the
outlet it is leaving the compressor with all its associated flow phenomena
such as increased swirl.
Furthermore, apart from the different distribution, it can be shown in the
data from sensor 1 of the outlet that there was an operating conditions were
a spurious low content is recorded, probably due a node affecting the sensors.
This highlights the risk of using SPL to characterize compressor in-duct noise
levels and the advantages of relying into sound intensity instead.

4.1.3.2. Spectrograms
Beside noise maps, an alternative way of analysing the spectral content
across different conditions consists of processing the interpolated data to
reconstruct spectrograms along lines of interest; in this case the working line
and the 160 krpm lines have been selected as in the previously presented
spectral content discussion.

along the path of the working line first shown in Fig. 4.1. This figure shows
how, specially in the outlet, a certain, typical “whoosh” content (1–2.5 kHz)
is present along the line. Intensity levels present a sudden step after 160
krpm of shaft speed.

In a similar manner, Fig. 4.16 shows the evolution of the intensity spectral
content as air mass flow is reduced, while keeping a constant corrected
shaft speed of 160 krpm. In this case, and again specially in the outlet duct,
broadband content between 1 and 3 kHz consistent with “whoosh” noise is
evident even at the highest considered mass flows which should be quite
stable. This broadband then becomes masked by the rise in levels as mass
flow rate is reduced.
It can also be seen in this figure how very low frequency content appears as
operating conditions get close to the deep surge limit. In the inlet case this
content under 1 kHz is dominant at these unstable conditions, whereas in
the case of the outlet the content is more broadband. As for higher frequency
content in the inlet duct, in both Figs. 4.15 and 4.16 spectral content is not
as consistent as in the outlet duct.

4.2. External noise
Besides the measurement of in-duct sound pressure and intensity, external
measurements of noise were performed during the experimental campaign
as well, taking advantage of the anechoic conditions of the chamber where
the turbocharger test rig was installed.
The equipment and methodology used in these experiments was described
in section 3.4. As seen in the literature review presented in chapter 2, external measurements of noise are commonplace in the available scientific works,
being also a common metric used by manufacturers. It is thus important to
relate the obtained in-duct results with these kind of external measurements.

4.2.1. Orifice noise

In-duct sound intensity ievel [dBSIL ]

External measurements of the orifice noise were carried out simultaneously
with the in-duct measurements at the same data points, to ensure that the
comparison between the two could be meaningful.
As previously detailed, data was captured with two free-field omnidirectional microphones placed perpendicular to the turbocharger axis line at
distances of 10 and 20 mm from the inlet duct orifice.

sound intensity considering both LCMV beamforming and the Two Microphone
Method.

In Fig. 4.17 a correlation is shown between the in-duct sound intensity
levels measured in the inlet and those measured by the first microphone
situated at 10 mm from the orifice by applying free-field conditions to
compute intensity, as detailed in chapter 3. In the case of the in-duct SIL, the
results from the LCMV beamforming method and the traditional Seybert’s
[82] Two Microphone Method (TMM) are shown, with the LCMV procedure
showing a better statistical agreement in terms of R2 with the free-field
orifice data. Results from the second microphone offered a similar result.

4.2.2. Surface radiation
Apart from taking advantage of the anechoic environment to measure orifice
noise, noise radiation data was also recorded by four additional free-field
microphones distributed around the turbocharger assembly, as shown previously in chapter 3.
In this case however, unlike the previously described orifice measurements
where acquisition was simultaneous with the compressor map characterization and thus they covered the whole selected region, measurements were
restricted to the two characteristic lines used in this chapter: the engine
working line and the 160 krpm speed line.

Furthermore, a sequential damping of the different parts of the assembly
(inlet duct, outlet duct, the turbocharger group itself and nothing at all) was
performed using acoustic insulation blankets wrapped around them in order
to isolate the distinct contribution of each part.
Results from this sequential testing procedure can be seen in Fig. 4.18
considering the operating conditions of the working line. In this case full
spectrum RMS SPL averaged between the four encircling microphones are
shown.
As expected radiated sound increases with shaft speed as predicted by the
in-duct measurements. In almost all conditions sound levels radiated by
the outlet are higher that those radiated by the inlet, and those are, in turn,
higher than those radiated by the turbocharger group itself.

In Fig. 4.19 a similar analysis is carried out for four points of the 160 krpm
speed line, from a higher flow rate stable point to a lower flow rate at more
unstable conditions. In this case it can be seen again how, as expected, noise
content rises towards deep surge.
However, at higher mass flow it is now the inlet duct the one exhibiting
higher noise levels. As flow rate is reduced, the outlet duct takes against
the lead on noise radiation. Between the last two points that are closer to
surge, inlet contribution does not increase, only those of the of the outlet
and turbocharger group.

4.3. Conclusions
In this chapter the main results of the experimental measurement campaign
are presented. These concern specially the data gathered through in-duct
measurements in both inlet and outlet pipes of the compressor, although
some data from external measurements is also presented.
Analysis was first performed by considering the spectral signature of the
pressure data in two sets of measurements: the working line of the engine
which is representative of the different air flow rate and shaft speeds that
the compressor may experience in normal operation, and a speed line or
characteristic line where corrected shaft speed was maintained at 160 krpm,
and mass flow rate was reduced from stable conditions to a point close to
the deep surge limit.
Pressure wave decomposition was shown to be a helpful technique to
enhance the spectral information coming from the compressor and filter out
the reflections coming from the opposite ends of the pipes, thereby aiding
to eliminate standing waves and offering cleaner spectral information.
In these improved results it became easier to identify relevant features such
as the Blade Passing Frequency and its harmonics, along with a broadband
hump between 1 and 3 kHz that is consistent with a super-synchronous
phenomenon known in the literature as “whoosh noise”, being of special
concern due to its negative perception in automotive applications.
This particular noise phenomenon was more easily detected in the acoustic
signature of the outlet duct, being more prominent at higher shaft speeds. At
these higher speeds the hump was noticeable even at the more stable higher
mass flow rate conditions. As flow rate was diminished, rising levels of lower
and higher frequency phenomena masked the presence of this hump.
Non-dimensional analysis showed that the hump identified with “whoosh”
was sensible to the mean velocity of the flow, rather than to the shaft speed
or the sound speed, thus pointing to a flow-related generation rather than
to a transmission-related one. The higher frequency TCN-like broadband on
the other hand, seems to be heavily dependent of transmission factors such
as the sound speed.
Furthermore, this later phenomenon shows an abrupt collapse at frequencies of plane wave transmission at all the considered points, suggesting
that its source mechanism cannot propagate in this condition. This would
confirm that this TCN-like phenomenon is indeed different from “whoosh”,
which is a broadband noise that, on the other hand, does appear at the plane
wave range.

Noise maps were also constructed from the interpolation of in-duct acoustic intensity across the different operating conditions considered in the study.
In this way it was shown how onset of low frequency (<100 Hz) phenomena
was parallel to the surge limit, whereas content on the “whoosh” band followed a different distribution, with its onset appearing more closely related
to the null slope point of the characteristic line rather than to proximity of
deep surge.
Analysis of the higher frequency maps became more difficult as pressure
wave decomposition could not be performed due to the propagation of higher
order acoustic modes that nullify the plane wave assumption required by the
procedure. It was observed that while inlet PSD maps were similar for the
three sensors of the array, distribution of the levels in the outlet presented
important differences even considering the relatively small distance between
each sensor, including in some cases spurious readings.
This reinforces the notion that PSD measurements with a single sensor,
specially in the outlet duct where the flow is less uniform and features a high
swirl, should be avoided if possible, preferring if feasible acoustic intensity
measurements.
In order to visualize how frequency content changed through the two
different sets of conditions, spectrograms were constructed from the interpolated data of the maps for both inlet and outlet. Specially in the later it can
be seen how content in the “whoosh” noise band is present even at lower
shaft speeds and higher mass flow rate conditions.
Taking advantage of the anechoic environment in which the turbocharger
was installed, orifice noise measurements performed with free-field microphones near the inlet mouth were used to compute a correlation with the
in-duct intensity. In-duct intensity was calculated with both the beamforming procedure and the two microphone method, with the first resulting
in better agreement and less dispersion, thereby confirming that the technique is suitable to estimate orifice noise without the need of an anechoic
environment.
Finally, surface radiation was measured in a sequential test in which the
different parts were damped: inlet and outlet ducts and turbocharger group.
Results from these tests showed that the outlet duct featured generally a
higher contribution than the inlet to the radiated noise, except at the higher
mass flow rate conditions. It is thereby important to take into account the
target operating conditions when deciding which duct design and damping
should be prioritized.

CHAPTER 5

Validation on real engine conditions
While in the previous chapter results were shown from an experimental campaign carried out in the controlled environment of an anechoic test chamber,
with the turbine being powered by a flow rig, automotive turbochargers
work paired with a reciprocating combustion engine.
Reciprocating engines produce a pulsating flow that carries the spectral
content of the different cylinder firing sequence. This not only introduces a
tonal noise in the pressure signal that includes the main firings and their
harmonics.
This pulsating flow means that power is provided to the turbine according
to this pulsation, and thus the operating condition of the compressor becomes
affected by this pulsation as available power oscillates, an effect which could
affect the different flow phenomena occurring in the compressor such as
stall, blade vortex shedding, etc.
Another important consideration is that robust methodologies are needed
to perform acoustic characterization in the environment of production engine
test cells, which are usually neither anechoic nor designed for acoustic
measurements.
In the previous chapter it was shown how SPL measurements performed
with a single sensor in the outlet or inlet duct are vulnerable against reflections, standing waves, and other effects of the transmission and the pipe
geometry, while acoustic intensity gives more robust results.
Acoustic intensity in the previous chapter was computed inside the ducts
with flow using pressure wave decomposition, primarily through the use
of a LCMV beamforming technique on the data collected by arrays of presWork in this chapter has been partly published in the following paper:
Acoustic characterization of automotive turbocompressors [3]

81

sure transducers mounted flush in a straight duct section in both inlet and
outlet pipes. The classical Seybert’s two microphone method [82] was also
tested for comparison against orifice noise measurements, albeit the LCMV
beamforming performed better.
In this chapter, an experimental campaign is described where acoustic
measurements were taken in the engine test cell described in section 3.1.3.
The objective of this experimental campaign was to test the application of
the methodology laid out in chapter 3 in an engine environment and to
ensure that conclusions and observations made in chapter 4 were still valid
in this more realistic case.

5.1. Engine cell setup
Reviewing the available literature on noise characterization of turbocharger
compressors, as done in chapter 2, it becomes readily apparent that due to
the measurement limitations mentioned above and the difficulty of operating
both the turbocharger and the engine at the same time to achieve precise
operating conditions, most of the data comes from flow rig measurements.
However, some studies regarding the acoustic performance of turbocharger
compressors on engine conditions can be found, such as those presented
by Evans and Ward [23, 24], Teng and Homco [10], Pai et al. [32, 33] and
Galindo et al. [61, 67, 95], the later specially concerned by low frequency
surge noise.
Two different approaches for measuring turbocharger noise are found in
these works. One of them is based on measuring radiated noise by means of
exterior ambient microphones inside the engine test cell. In these conditions
however, it is difficult to separate the radiation of the compressor group
and pipes from the engine combustion noise and the auxiliary systems.
Furthermore, as engine test cells are not usually anechoic, reflections will
affect the data collected by ambient microphones, adding another important
source of experimental error.
As an alternative, some authors have relied into a flow microphone or a
pressure transducer situated inside the inlet duct of the compressor. However,
as previously stated, this approach is affected by the particular geometry and
reflections of the duct, as only Sound Pressure Level (SPL) can be computed
from a single sensor in a duct with flow.
In this campaign it was thus decided to adapt the beamforming setup to
the engine test cell, in order to apply the pressure wave decomposition that
would allow the calculation of Sound Intensity Level (SIL).

carried out in the engine test cell.

The experimental installation includes thus an array of piezoelectric pressure sensors flush-mounted in an extension of the compressor inlet pipe.
These sensors were used to test the beamforming method and perform a comparison against the two-microphone method in engine conditions. Sound
pressure level (SPL) of a single sensor as used frequently in the aforementioned literature was also computed to assess the difference with intensity
results.
A commercial intensity probe (Brüel & Kjær Type 4197) consisting of
two phase-matched 1/2” microphones was also installed at the inlet orifice
as a reference, surrounded by acoustic insulation mats in order to avoid
reflections from the walls or other components of the engine cell. Fig. 5.1
shows an schematic view of this experimental setup.
The engine used in this study was a 2L, 4-cylinder Diesel engine, very
representative of common engines for automotive application, rated at a
maximum power of 120 kW and maximum torque of 340 Nm. It featured a
16 valve system and a variable geometry turbine (VGT) turbocharger. The
inlet duct of this turbocharger was modified and enlarged with an additional
straight section in order to install the pressure transducer array and ensure
proper development of the flow. In Fig. 5.2 some images of the modified
inlet duct can be seen.
Also visible in this figure is the dynamo-metric brake that was used to
control the power and torque of the engine, allowing the selection of the
desired operating conditions of the engine. Due to the presence of this brake,
the enlarged inlet duct had to be provided with a flexible section so it could
be angled slightly.
A particular feature of this engine test cell is that it allows the use of
compressed air injection into the inlet manifold, after the intercooler. More
details and schematics about this particular aspect of the setup can be found

in [61, 67]. A reservoir is added to smooth out irregularities that could be
present in the injected flow. This reservoir can be seen in the bottom-right
corner of Fig. 5.2.
In essence, by regulating the pressure and mass rate of this compressed
airflow the engine cylinders are provided with additional air and as a result,
less air is ingested by the compressor by effect of the variable geometry
turbine.
This allows an additional degree of freedom in order to change the operating condition of the compressor without affecting the operation of the Diesel
engine. A drawback of this method however, is that in this way constant
pressure ratio lines are measured, not the characteristic, constant shaft speed
lines that are usually plotted in the compressor map.
As done in the previous measurement campaigns, it is necessary to evaluate
the restrictions that the chosen acoustic characterization methods impose in
the frequency domain. While SPL is only limited by the frequency response
of the particular sensor, the decomposition algorithms of both the twomicrophone method and the beamforming method present some common
additional restrictions which were discussed in chapter 3.
The first one is that both methods are formulated considering plane wave
propagation, and are thus theoretically restricted to the frequency range
below the onset of higher order modes, which can be computed according
to the expressions provided by Eriksson [83].

Another restriction is the one related to the spatial resolution of the consecutive sensors [82], which imposes a cut-off frequency similar in concept
to a Nyquist limit for spatial (rather than temporal) sampling, based on the
separation ds of the sensors. It is important to take into account that above
this frequency limit, spurious spatial aliasing effects will be introduced.

Using the setup described a measurement campaign was carried out where
the region of the compressor map closer to surge was characterized by
varying the injected additional air mass at different pressure ratios.
The interpolating procedure described in chapter 3 was used to build a
noise level map between 1 and 3 kHz equivalent to those obtained in the
anechoic chamber test rig, which is shown in Fig. 5.3.
In this figure, it can be seen how the intensity level distribution is similar
to that obtained in the continuous flow test rig. Noise increase in this
particularly concerning band is again located at higher shaft speeds and low
mass flow rate, and again the contours are not parallel to the deep surge
limit as it is the case with lower frequency content but grouped towards the
upper left corner of the map.

frequency band (1 – 3 kHz) as measured through the LCMV beamforming
procedure in the engine test cell.

As due to the different measurement procedure each line of data points
is recorded at iso-pressure rather than iso-speed, it is not possible to judge
whether the increase is again linked to the point of maximum pressure ratio.
Still, it can be concluded that results in terms of noise level distribution are
in line with those obtained in previous observations.

at 2.2 pressure ratio, including a low frequency zoomed view.

Influence of the engine in the recorded in-duct spectral content can be
seen in Fig. 5.4 where the raw sound pressure level measured by one of
the array sensors is shown for the 2.2 pressure ratio data points. While the
overall distribution is similar to those observed in the continuous flow test
rig, featuring a slope in the plane wave range and a broadband at higher
frequencies1 , a zoom at the lower part of the spectra shows a very clear
peak at the cylinder firing frequency, accompanied by harmonics and other
tonal noise phenomena produced by the engine, which could be related for
instance with the air management system.

Although in this particular case BPF is not being observed upstream of the compressor.

5.3. Methodology validation
Fig. 5.5 shows the in-duct sound spectra computed with the three discussed
methods: SPL with one sensor, two-microphone approach, and LCMV beamforming. The spectra measured at the orifice by the reference probe is
superimposed in blue. In this region, the beamforming method appears to
follow the reference more closely.
It is also shown how spurious aliasing peaks occur at the frequency predicted by expression 3.3.6 when more than one sensor is used and how the
onset of the 1st radial mode predicted by expression 3.3.7 marks the start
of a clear difference between the in-duct sound field and the sound field
radiated by the inlet orifice.
The results of applying the intensity equation 3.3.2 to compute SIL in the
plane wave region of the spectra at different operating conditions of the
compressor are shown in Fig. 5.6. Absolute levels at each working point
were interpolated in order to get a continuous map. The beamforming and
the two-microphone methods were used for in-duct SIL estimation and the
intensity probe for measuring the reference orifice SIL. Correlations of these
measurements are also provided, showing that in the plane wave range the
beamforming method appears to perform up to 30% better in terms of R2 .

methods (SPL, beamforming and two-microphone) and orifice sound intensity

Fig. 5.7 shows a comparison between the SPL computed by selecting only
one sensor of the array and the reference SIL of the probe. The correlation
of these two measurements is better in terms of R2 than the two-microphone
method but still worse than the beamforming method.
However, it should be noted that simple sound pressure level measurements
can be influenced by the complex geometry of actual production pipes, which
are remarkably more complex than the straight pipe used in this study. Also,
it can be seen in Fig. 5.7 that, while at low pressure the sound maps are

quite similar, SPL of one probe predicts a high sound level at high pressure
ratio and high mass flow conditions, which is not the case for the intensity
probe.
These high sound level points at high pressure ratio can be clearly seen
as points lying outside the 95% observation confidence bounds of the correlation in Fig. 5.7. A similar problem can be seen in the correlation of
the two-microphone method in Fig. 5.6, in which some outliers appear
to distort the map at some operation zones. The beamforming method,
however, appears to be more robust.

5.4. Radiated noise
Besides in-duct measurements, another acoustic characterization approach
consists in the measurement of noise radiated by the turbocharger and its
pipes, in most cases using free field microphones at a given distance from
the setup.
This method has the advantage of allowing measurements with the real
geometry, without any modification in the pipes to mount the in-duct measurement sensors. However, for accurate measurements it is desirable that
the test cell be anechoic in order to prevent disturbances in measurements
caused by reflections in the engine cell walls and resonances created by the
cavities of the engine or its ducts that appear as other noise sources.
As testing the whole engine setup requires a large and expensive anechoic
chamber, the setup is sometimes reduced to just the turbocharger group,
which is powered by an external compressor or electric motor, losing in this
way the possibility of performing on-engine tests.
However, a novel procedure based on measuring acoustic particle velocity
level (PVL) may solve these issues [90] and enable on-engine testing in
non-anechoic environments. This method, briefly introduced in chapter
3, makes use of two microscopic filaments acting as hot-wire flowmeters.
Measuring the small voltage drop between the two, it is possible to derivate
the acoustic particle velocity in the plane of the sensor.
Such a method, in this case a commercial solution providing acoustic
holography-like maps of radiated noise level [91], has been tested on the
(non-anechoic) engine test cell. The measuring probe of this device houses

the two filaments on a MEMS chip and a traditional microphone, allowing the
comparison of the performance of acoustic particle velocity measurements
against traditional free-field sound pressure level (SPL) measurements.
Fig. 5.8 shows this comparison. SPL (left) and PVL (right) maps of the
measured engine environment are provided by tracking the probe along
the near field of the surfaces of interest. The frequencies considered in
these maps have been restricted to the 800–2000 Hz range, where the
broadband emission of “whoosh” noise was produced by the turbocharger.

For two particular regions (turbocharger group and inlet duct, marked on
the maps) the full pressure (top) and particle velocity (bottom) spectra are
also provided in Fig. 5.9.
The particle velocity technique clearly distinguishes the turbocharger as
the source of a ∼700–2000 Hz broadband noise (at this particular operating
condition) consistent with “whoosh”. The pressure method also appears to
identify the turbocharger as the source, but the contrast with the surrounding
areas is much less pronounced. This can be clearly seen in spectra of Fig. 5.9,
in which the SPL level (top) of this frequency band is similar in both zones
(turbocharger and inlet) while in the case of the PVL spectra (bottom), the
turbocharger contribution is visibly higher, exhibiting the typical hump of
“whoosh” noise.
However, the pressure method appears to be more sensitive to reflections
in the near field and was thus unable to provide a clear identification. It
should be noted that if characterization through in-duct techniques of this
particular whoosh noise is intended, special attention should be placed on
the outlet pipe, as this phenomenon is often found exclusively downstream
of the turbo-charger.

5.5. Conclusions
Characterization of the acoustic performance of a given compressor under
engine conditions must start with the definition of test means. If an anechoic
chamber capable of housing the entire engine is available, then free field
microphones can be used to estimate the acoustic radiation, but even in this
case it would be difficult to isolate the contribution of the compressor.
In order to quantify the compressor noise emission, an intensity probe can
be located at the inlet orifice. However, intensity probes are quite expensive,
and sufficient acoustic insulation is necessary to prevent reflections. Also,
characteristics of the internal field that are not externally propagated will
be lost.
In this chapter it has been show that in-duct noise measurements offer
a cost-effective way to characterize the sound field generated by the compressor, if the ducts can be modified so as to include straight measurement
sections. Single-sensor SPL may be used to investigate the upper frequency
bands, but generally sound intensity is a better and more meaningful metric
of the acoustic power output of the source.

Calculation of in-duct sound intensity can be achieved by using an additional consecutive sensor and decomposing the waves through the twomicrophone method. However, the addition of a third sensor and the decomposition through the beamforming method appears to be more reliable
along the full plane wave range, and especially in the lower frequencies
(250–1000 Hz).
As shown in previous chapters however, the restrictions of these intensitybased methods must be carefully considered, specially the influence of
higher order modes and the aliasing frequency limit introduced by the
spatial sampling imposed by the sensor spacing. In addition in this onengine situation, the pulsation intrinsically imposed by the operation of the
reciprocating engine must be taken into account as not only its main firing
frequency but also its harmonics are present in the lower frequency part of
the spectrum of the turbocharger inlet.
Regarding the external radiated noise, the particle velocity method has
been able to provide more contrast than the pressure method and to correctly
identify the turbocharger as the source of noise radiation at the particular
“whoosh” noise band, in accordance with previous results.
The particle velocity method could therefore be useful to reconstruct noise
maps similar to those obtained using in-duct measurements, isolating the
signal from the acoustic near field of the area of interest at different working
conditions, without the need of modifying the original duct geometry or
ensuring anechoic conditions.

CHAPTER 6

Validation of numerical simulations
“As is evident to all, fire and earth and water and air are
bodies. And every sort of body possesses solidity, and
every solid must necessarily be contained in planes; and
every plane rectilinear figure is composed of triangles.”

Plato, Timaeus.

Numerical simulations of physical problems have been demonstrated to be
a valuable tool for the analysis and understanding of phenomena that may
be difficult to directly measure or characterize exclusively by experimental
means.
These kind of simulations are also very valuable in the development stage of
engineering applications, where different prototype variations or operating
conditions can be simulated simultaneously without the cost and risks of
traditional experimental setups.
However, it is of the utmost importance to properly validate these numerical tools in order to ensure that the results that are being obtained through
their use correspond accurately enough with the physical reality, as small
changes in the geometrical model, boundary conditions or numerical algorithms for solving the problem can have a great influence on the outcome of
the simulation.

Work in this chapter has been partly published in the following papers:
Methodology for experimental validation of a CFD model for predicting noise generation
in centrifugal compressors [1]
Numerical and experimental analysis of automotive turbocharger compressor aeroacoustics at different operating conditions [4]

95

In this chapter the use of experimental data and signal processing techniques to validate a numerical model of a turbocharger compressor is presented, including the validation in terms of global variables, local flow field,
acoustic results and different operating conditions of the system.

6.1. CFD simulation setup
The development of this numerical model, including the assessment of
the influence of spatial and temporal discretization, turbulence models,
boundary conditions, tip clearance, etc. was performed in the framework of
the doctoral thesis of R. Navarro [96], where full details about the model
can be found.
In consequence, in this section only a brief description of the numerical
model will be provided, covering only the most relevant details for the
validation discussion and the use of simulation results in the analysis of the
physical problem.

6.1.1. Computational domain
The first step in any numerical model is
the decision on the extent at which the real
setup will be included in the computational
domain. In this case the real setup is the
one described in section 3.3, this is, the
turbocharger and pipes that were installed
in the anechoic chamber rig.
In order to ensure that the fidelity of the
simulated geometry to the real one was
kept, a real compressor of the same exact
model of the one installed in the experimental test rig was disassembled and digitized.
A structured-light 3D scanner was used to Figure 6.1: Polyhedral mesh of the
rotor walls (grey) and the surobtain a point cloud, which was interporounding fluid (blue) used in the

software post-processing.
To avoid the influence of manufacturing differences that the real compressor could have had, only one main blade and one splitter blade were
digitized, the rest of them being cloned into the final model. Tip clearance

and backplate gap were also included in the digitized CAD model. The fluid
domain was extracted by considering the spaces between the reconstructed
surfaces. A sample of the resulting mesh can be seen in Fig. 6.1.
This non-structured mesh consisted of 9.5 million polyhedral cells arranged
as to obtain y + values1 close to 1 near the impeller walls. Inflation cell
layers were used near the walls to enhance these values, with the size of the
polyhedral cells being enlarged farther from the walls to reduce the total
size of the mesh.
Once that the turbocharger compressor fluid volumes were obtained and
meshed, inlet and outlet sections of the digitized compressor were used to
create short inlet and outlet pipes by extruding these cross sections up to a
distance of five of their diameters. Only these short pipes were considered,
as simulating the full piping described in chapter 3 was considered too
computationally expensive.
In Fig. 6.2 these short inlet and outlet ducts considered in the numerical
simulations are compared with the real experimental setup as installed in
the anechoic chamber test rig. It can be seen in the figure that the real pipes
were much longer than the simulated ones.
The so-called y + is a dimensionless parameter used in boundary layer theory. Some
turbulence models work best when it is close to 1 in the first cell adjacent to the wall.

There was also a change in diameter in the inlet pipe mandated by the
available measurement pipes and flow meter diameter. As this figure evidences, extending the CFD domain up to the limit of these ducts would have
notably increased the simulation time.

6.1.2. Case setup
Once that the mesh was built, the case was solved using a segregated solver
in the commercial CFD software package Star-CCM+ [97]. A DES (Detached
Eddy Simulation) simulation was performed, using an SST k − ω turbulence
model. This hybrid strategy [98] uses a combination of sub-grid-scale where
possible taking into account grid size, and Reynolds-averaged equations
where not [99], and should be helpful to resolve the finer flow structures
that may be involved in noise generation. A similar solution was used by
Mendonça et al. [100, 37].
Outlet pressure and inlet mass flow rate were chosen as boundary conditions for the simulations, with values for them taken from the experimental
campaign described in previous chapters. Specific operating conditions for
the reference simulation can be found in table 6.1.
Rigid body motion simulation was chosen for the transient setup, with the
time step adjusted to so that the impeller mesh turned 1º per time step at
the selected shaft speed, which imposed a sufficient maximum frequency
according to the Nyquist criterion, well above hearing range.
Regarding heat transfer, the problem is considered adiabatic. Surface
roughness, coupled mechanical deformations and shaft eccentricity that
dynamically affected the tip clearance were also disregarded for simplicity.

6.1.3. Solution monitors
Besides other monitors dedicated to general fluid field visualization, some
additional pressure monitors were added to the simulated inlet and outlet
ducts in order to gather data for the specific purpose of acoustic validation
of the numerical solution.

Figure 6.3: Dimensional drawing of the real compressor inlet and outlet
pipes, including the piezoelectric sensor arrays for the experimental wave
decomposition and highlighting the CFD simulation domain.

Three different kinds of specific solution monitors were considered: a
single-point pressure recording flush to the wall of the ducts, a similar singlepoint monitor in the centre of the duct, and finally an area-averaged pressure
recording comprising the whole duct cross section.
Wall-flush pressure monitors were intended to replicate the position of
the piezoelectric transducer used in the experimental campaign. Centerline
monitors were used to assess differences between data recorded at this
location, which could not be measured experimentally without perturbing
the flow, and the data gathered by the wall-flush sensors.
As cross section area-averaged pressure monitors should produce the same
results than the other two at the plane wave frequency range, they were
introduced to test if the averaging of the pressure introduced differences.
The monitors can be seen in Fig. 6.3. It can be seen that all three types of
monitors were replicated at three different cross sections in both inlet and
outlet duct, in order to mimic the array installed in the real setup and also
to assess the influence of the longitudinal distance to the compressor on the
results.

6.2. Validation methodology
Once that enough iterations of the simulation solution were performed so that
frequency resolution of the simulated pressure signal spectra was suitable
for comparison, a validation effort was carried out in order to ascertain if
the numerical model reproduced the compressor behaviour with enough
accuracy as to use the simulation results to obtain extract information about
flow features that are difficult to visualize experimentally.

6.2.1. Global variables
A first step of this validation methodology consisted in comparing global results of the variables that are normally used to characterize the performance
of the compressor since if these simple checks were not good, the particular
simulation setup should be further refined.
For instance, specific work Wu and isentropic efficiency ηs are two relevant
parameters of the compressor operation, defined from the basic thermodynamic variables as follows:

Wu =

(6.2.1)

Here, Ω is the rotation speed in rad/s, τ is the torque as computed by
the integration of simulated forces, c p is the specific heat of air, Π is the
total-to-total pressure ratio, γ is the heat capacity ratio and the subscript T
refers to total conditions in either inlet or outlet.
Furthermore, this total-to-total pressure ratio Π is also a result of the
simulation that must be validated. Since mass flow rate, outlet pressure
and shaft speed were selected as boundary conditions, inlet pressure of
the solution will give a pressure ratio that must be compared against the
experimental data.
To avoid small variations in time, both experimental and CFD simulation
variables such as pressures, temperatures and velocities were averaged in
a 5 seconds window, before applying equations 6.2.1. Table 6.2 shows the
results of the computed global variables in both cases, including the relative
error between them, defined for each variable ψ as:

R

It can be seen in this table that the accuracy of global parameter prediction
is good, with less than 1% of relative error between the CFD and experimental
results, even taking into account the simplifying hypothesis considered for
the numerical simulation.
This shows that the numerical model of the compressor is successfully
reproducing the operating conditions of the real system so that averaged
variables such as mean Mach number, temperatures and pressures that are
needed for the acoustic analysis are well reproduced.

6.2.2. Acoustic results
However, the fact that these global time-averaged parameters are in good
agreement does not guarantee that the simulation setup is precise enough
to reproduce the kind of transient flow phenomena that are related to the
acoustic behaviour of the compressor.
In a subsequent step of the validation analysis, the spectral content of
the simulated pressure data gathered by the monitors described above was
compared with the experimental data gathered by the fast piezoelectric
sensors.

6.2.2.1. Total pressure spectra
First, comparison between experimental and numerical results was performed using the spectral content of the total pressure, this is, without
applying the wave decomposition algorithm to any of the signals. In Fig. 6.4
this comparison is shown taking into account the three types of CFD monitors
described in subsection 6.1.3.

Figure 6.4: Comparison of total spectral content between the experimental

type of monitor.

It can be seen in this figure that as theoretically predicted, spectral content
measured by the three different CFD monitors collapses in the plane wave
frequency range for both inlet and outlet as pressure varies evenly in time
across the cross-section.
This collapse of the signals ends when the wall monitor starts to show
different spectral content after a certain frequency. This cut-off frequency
almost exactly matches the theoretically predicted frequency at which the
first asymmetric mode starts propagating.

Axis and surface monitor spectra remain collapsed until a higher frequency
when another separation happens, again matching almost exactly the cut-off
frequency of the first radial mode.
Explanation of how these different kind of monitors are affected by these
two higher order modes can be found by considering Fig. 6.5. As the first
asymmetric mode starts propagating, the axial monitor is located in its modal
line, thus is not influenced by cross-section pressure fluctuations. The area
average monitor evens out these fluctuations, thereby the only monitors
being influenced being those located at the wall.

Figure 6.5: Schematic of modal lines of the two relevant acoustic modes in
relation to the different types of CFD monitors considered in the model.

When the first radial mode starts propagating at a higher frequency, the
axial monitor is not in the modal line any more, and thus its pressure spectral
content separates from the surface monitor which continues to average the
cross-sectional fluctuations.
Thereby it can be concluded that the CFD model is accurately predicting the
cut-off frequencies at which higher order acoustic modes start propagating
through the duct.
It can also be seen that BPF tonal noise peak is captured by the numerical
model, although more clear in the outlet results that in the inlet ones. The
pressure monitor located at the wall features the clearest BPF peak, even
showing a small peak in the inlet case at the correct frequency of 16 kHz.
However, agreement between the CFD predicted signals and the experimental results is not so good in terms of PSD level and trend in the spectra,
specially above the plane wave frequency range. The outlet pipe simulated
spectra seems to feature an standing wave pattern, related to the short
length of the pipe and lack of non-reflecting boundary conditions.

6.2.2.2. Decomposed spectra
As shown in chapter 4 the use of pressure wave decomposition can offer
clearer spectra as the components coming from the compressor are more
isolated from the reflections coming from the duct endings.
In the case of the experimental data, the decomposition was performed
according to the three-sensor LCMV beamformer described in section 3.3.1.2.
However, as CFD allows unfettered access to all of the flow variables at
any point of the simulated domain, other pressure wave decomposition
methods are available, such as the Method of Characteristic (MoC) that was
implemented following the formulation proposed in [101, 102, 103]:

Here, advantage is taken of the CFD ability to obtain instantaneous local

ratio and pref is a suitable reference pressure. Fig. 6.6 shows the result of
applying this algorithm to the wall CFD monitor.

Figure 6.6: Comparison of experimental and simulated total pressure against

As shown in the figure, the decomposed pressure spectra show a better
agreement with the experimental data as the periodic oscillations present in
the simulated pressure spectra are alleviated. The trend of both reference
and simulated spectra are similar overall, although discrepancies can be
observed, specially at lower frequencies below 2 kHz.
While the numerically simulated spectra is able to capture the characteristic peak of the Blade Passing Frequency (BPF) tonal noise at 16 kHz, the
broadband noise that is visible in the experimental data between approximately 13 and 17 kHz is not reproduced by the CFD model, suggesting that
the source mechanism of this particular phenomena is not being correctly
considered in the simulation.

Figure 6.7: Comparison of experimental and simulated total pressure against
simulated decomposed pressure in the outlet case, using the Method of Characteristics and the section monitor. Black lines indicate mode onset.

In Fig. 6.7 a similar comparison is made, using now time the section
monitor (area-averaged pressure). In this case the Method Of Characteristics
decomposition procedure allows for a better match between experimental
and simulated spectral content at the plane wave range, below the first
asymmetric acoustic mode onset at 7.4 kHz.
However, using this monitor type, higher frequency content after the
acoustic modes start propagating does not feature a good agreement with
the reference experimental data. Blade Passing Frequency (BPF) tonal noise
is not captured as clearly as with the single-point wall monitor, and neither
is the broadband centred around 15 kHz.

Specially in the case of the BPF tonal noise, this could be due to the fact
that the area-averaging process is neglecting the pressure differences across
the cross-section, that are still picked up by the single-point CFD monitor.
Regarding the plane wave frequency range where the agreement between
CFD and experimental data is better, Fig. 6.8 shows the comparison of
decomposed pressure wave spectra in both inlet and outlet ducts.

Figure 6.8: Comparison of decomposed pressure spectral content between the
experimental data (through beamforming) and the simulation results using
the surface monitor (through the method of characteristics).

Data from the decomposed signals is shown both at the highest frequency
resolution available in the CFD calculation (∼16 Hz) and smoothed through
a moving average filter in order to better show the shape of the spectra. As
the experimental data is decomposed though the beamforming procedure
described in chapter 3, frequency is limited not only by the onset of the first
acoustic mode but also by the spatial Nyquist-like criterion.
In can be seen in this figure that the match between simulated and measured pressure waves coming back through the inlet from the compressor
is not so good. While the experimental signal features an approximately
plane spectra with only a slight “hump” of ∼4 dB at the “whoosh” noise
frequency between 1.5 and 2.5 kHz, the simulated pressure wave features
an oscillatory behaviour.
In the case of the outlet spectra however, a better agreement between
the numerical prediction and the experimental data is found. The CFD
simulation result appears to accurately follow the trend of the measurements,
including the broadband between 1 and 2.5 kHz that is commonly associated
with the “whoosh” noise phenomenon.
This ability of the numerical model to predict the whoosh noise phenomenon in the outlet duct while not completely matching the experimental
inlet results seems to point to the primary source of “whoosh” noise not
being located in the inlet flow structures but rather in a downstream point
where simulations are more accurate.
Nevertheless, it is shown in Fig. 6.8 that the CFD model appears to contain a source of broadband noise between 1 and 2.5 kHz that matches the
experimental results. Thereby, post-processing of the CFD simulation data
could be useful to locate the source mechanism of this phenomenon and,
furthermore, the effect on whoosh noise of mitigating solutions could be
simulated using this model before its physical implementation.

6.3. Operating conditions study
After performing the validation and optimization of the CFD model at the
reference operating conditions (160 krpm of shaft speed and 77 g/s of
corrected air mass flow), a further study was performed where two additional operating settings of the compressor were simulated by modifying the
boundary conditions according to the experimentally measured data points,
keeping the rest of the model parameters unchanged.

In order to analyze the differences in terms

at different degrees of unstable operating
conditions, the two additional simulations
were performed at the same shaft speed of
160 krpm, in one case at a higher air mass
flow (∼109 g/s) and in the other case at a

structures such as the inlet backflow would
be already well developed.
Simulations carried out in this campaign were also performed using an
unsteady RANS turbulence model in addition to the DES model that was
considered for the reference study, to assess the influence that the turbulence
model could have in the numerical results.
Again, the first step of the validation process involved checking the same
global parameters of the compressor performance that were analyzed for
the reference case. In Fig. 6.9 the comparison of the numerical predictions
for these parameters is shown against the previously measured experimental
values.

It can be seen in this figure that while the prediction of isentropic efficiency
(bottom plot) and specific work (middle plot) is in good agreement with the
experimental data, in the case of the total-to-total pressure ratio (top plot)
the agreement is not so good.
The least accurate prediction is that of the highest flow case, where the
difference in terms of pressure ratio is larger. It should be noted as well
that in this case, small variations in the predicted temperature and pressure
resulted in a slight change in corrected air mass flow.
Regarding the differences between the two considered turbulence models,
predictions in terms of isentropic efficiency and specific work are quite
similar, with the larger differences in the case of the total-to-total pressure
ratio.
This last difference between the two models is large enough so that it
changes the slope of the speed line, with the RANS model correctly predicting
a decrease in pressure ratio at lower mass flow and the DES model failing
to do so, despite having less relative error.

in the experimental test rig and those predicted by the numerical model.

Differences quantified in terms of relative error as defined by expression 6.2.2 are provided in table 6.3. It can be seen how, although larger that
in the reference case of 77 g/s on which the setup was developed, relative
errors are still smaller than 3% in the two additional operating settings as
calculated with both DES and RANS turbulence models.
While this table shows how the use of an unsteady RANS model resulted
in less relative error overall, specially in terms of isentropic efficiency at
the lower flow operating point, it should be remarked that only the DES
model correctly predicted the decrease in pressure ratio as flow was near
surge conditions and impeller blades began stalling, suggesting that these
unstable flow phenomena are better modelled using DES.

6.3.2. Pressure spectra
In addition to the validation of global variables, it is necessary to assess
if the spectral content of the pressure signal simulated by the model at
these new operating conditions still matches the trends observed during the
corresponding experimental measurements. In this subsection only the data
obtained using a DES model is presented.

Figure 6.10: Comparison of decomposed spectra in the plane wave range for
all three operating conditions and both ducts against experimental results.

In Fig. 6.10 a comparison is made in the same fashion as in Fig. 6.8 where
decomposed experimental and numerical signals are compared, selecting
the surface CFD monitor. The frequency range is thus limited by the experimental spatial criterion, not the first acoustical mode onset. It can be
seen that, although not featuring as good match as in the 77 g/s case, the
new simulations show a similar trend in spectral content compared against
experimental results.

Figure 6.12: Comparison of pressure spectra for all three operating conditions
and both ducts against experimental results in the plane wave range. In this
figure, pressure wave decomposition is only performed in the CFD spectra.

Analysis of these last two figures shows that the prediction capability of
the model in the higher frequencies is similar in the two new simulations
that in the reference one of 77 g/s. The higher frequency broadband seen in
both inlet and outlet ducts is still not reproduced by the CFD results, and the
level of the high frequency content in the inlet duct is still over-predicted.
Inspecting the plane wave range seen in Fig. 6.12 it is apparent that in the
case of the inlet, while still not a perfect match the trends of each flow rate
operating point feature good agreement to the experimental data.
In the case of the outlet results, while the trend at the lowest flow condition
is well predicted, for the two higher flow points of 77 and 109 g/s the
simulated spectral content captured by the wall monitor does not reproduce
correctly the “whoosh” noise hump between 1 and 2.5 kHz, over-predicting
the level of the lowest frequencies.

6.3.3. Selected CFD results
While the prediction of spectral content is not totally accurate yet, specially
in terms of levels, and thus more research should be devoted to enhance
the numerical model of the compressor, it has been shown that the model is
precise enough to reproduce the trends in spectral content, allowing some
selected results to be presented in order to provide better insight into the
flow conditions in the compressor.

Figure 6.13: Combination of selected CFD results for the lowest mass flow
rate operating condition (60 g/s), including pressure and velocity field and
diffuser frequency spectrum.

The kind of results that can be extracted from the CFD simulation are
exemplified in Fig. 6.13, which combines the 3D model of the compressor
wheel with plane views of the pressure and velocity fields, and frequency
information extracted from the time record of a particular position in the
diffuser. Note that in this particular setup the diffuser is rotating along with
the wheel so this monitor is not stationary.
Pressure information is presented in two planes, at the top of the inducer
and at the leading edge plane. 3D isosurfaces of P = 85 kPa are also shown,
forming “bubbles” that move from one channel to the next at a frequency
lower than that imposed by the wheel rotation. These recirculation “bubbles”
have been sometimes linked to broadband acoustic phenomena of half
rotating order (RO) [104, 105].
The radial velocity field is shown in the diffuser and the volute, revealing
an asymmetrical field and the presence of a higher speed zone near the
volute tongue. Frequency signature of the monitor is shown in the figure,
peaking at 2.9 kHz (∼10% over RO) and presenting two sidelobes. These
pulsations could also be related to “whoosh” noise generation.
Taking advantage of the three simulated flow rate conditions. in Fig. 6.14
the meridional velocity magnitude across the compressor wheel has been
plotted into an extended isospan surface. Data to build this surface has been
extracted from the inducer, the wheel, the diffuser and the volute, as shown
in the accompanying graphic.
This allows to compare how the velocity field changes across the compressor in all three of the selected operating conditions. Differences are easily
noticed between the point of higher flow and higher isentropic efficiency
(bottom) and the other two points.
In the 109 g/s simulation the velocity field is more axisymmetric, with all
blades and channels presenting a similar distribution. Flow in the inducer is
very regular, being attached to the blades in all cases. Flow distribution in
the diffuser and volute is no longer axisymmetric, featuring instead a wake
trail for each blade. Also, vortex shedding can be appreciated even in these
conditions close to the maximum efficiency point.
As mass flow rate of the CFD boundary condition was reduced to 77 g/s, a
more irregular velocity field is shown in the middle plot of the figure. Flow
in the inducer is not so regular as before, with some main blades featuring
reversed flow at the suction side (SS) near the leading edge creating flow
detachment. In the diffuser, a zone featuring increased velocity can be seen
near the tongue, where the volute is smaller, with the wake of the blades
not being so apparent as before.

Meridional velocity at isospan surface [m/s]

Figure 6.14: Comparison of meridional velocity field in a blade-to-blade
isospan surface, for the three selected operating conditions of the CFD model.

For the lowest flow rate condition at 60 g/s, the flow field in the inducer
became highly irregular, featuring some zone with reversed flow. Severe detachment of the flow can be appreciated in most of the blades, accompanied
by a similar high velocity zone in the diffuser near the volute tongue.
The presence of this high velocity zone (which by continuity also affects
pressure) can also be seen by attaching a moving pressure monitor to the
pressure side of one of the blades (marked with a black dot in Fig. 6.14)
and plotting the measured spectra, as seen in Fig. 6.15. Similarly to the
previously discussed velocity spectra, a peak is shown at the frequency of the
rotating order as the structure is seen by the blade once each revolution. A
secondary peak appears also at 2 RO, but the sidelobes are not reproduced.

Figure 6.15: Comparison of pressure spectral content recorded at the pressure
side of the trailing edge of an impeller blade between the three simulated
operating conditions.

These peaks are much more pronounced for the two cases of lower mass
flow rate where this zone was more easily identified, but still appears for
the 109 g/s case, indicating that still some influence of the volute restriction
affects the blades when they pass through this particular angular position.
Of particular interest among the different results that can be extracted
from the CFD simulation is the opportunity to analyze the complex flow
field that develops in the inducer and final part of the inlet duct as operating
conditions reach the mild surge area of the compressor map and flow is
reversed in direction.

showing the reversed flow extent and distribution, including isosurfaces of
low pressure “bubbles” in the same region.

In Fig. 6.16 this backflow is characterized for the 60 g/s condition (which
is well inside the marginal surge area as demonstrated by the slope of the
speed line) by plotting the isosurfaces where Vz = 0 m/s. At this operating
condition some low pressure “bubbles” of stalled flow are also present in
the inducer and are also plotted as isosurfaces, as in the previously seen
Fig. 6.13.
The same data is also shown in an inset plot for the 77 g/s operating
condition, which is the point that both experimental data and DES CFD
simulations identify as the one where the slope of the speed line reaches
zero and the marginal surge zone starts.
This 3D view of the pressure and velocity information shows how the
low pressure bubbles extend up to the limit of the reversed flow, in both
operating conditions. However, these low pressure zones are much more
axisymmetric in the 77 g/s point, whereas in the lower flow rate case they
become isolated and elongated. Time data shows also how they rotate inside
the backflow-affected area in a tornado-like fashion.
Regarding the backflow itself as characterized by the null vertical velocity
in the inlet, the figure shows the drastic evolution from an incipient recirculation at 77 g/s very close to the wheel, to the fully developed backflow at

60 g/s, reaching upstream up to 1.2 inducer diameters. It is also shown in
the 77 g/s view how this backflow will start appearing close to the inducer
walls, leaving the core flow still unperturbed.

6.4. Acoustic source location
While the analysis of raw pressure and velocity monitors can shed light into
the behaviour of the compressor from the fluid dynamics point of view by
identifying flow structures and spectral content at selected points of the
domain, other data post-processing techniques can be used to obtain further
insight into the acoustic behaviour of the system.

6.4.1. Fourier analysis
A way to explore the spatial distribution of the acoustic sources for different
frequencies of interest is to perform the Fourier transform at each cell of
different surfaces like walls and planes. Then, the amplitude of the transformed signal at the frequency of interest is used to color each cell the
selected surfaces, be it directly or through a smoothing interpolation.

component of the simulated pressure signal at 160 krpm and 77 g/s.

These kind of results are shown in Fig. 6.17 for some selected wall boundaries of the numerical domain. Simulated operating conditions are those
of the medium flow rate point at 77 g/s. The chosen frequency component
has been 3 kHz, as it is relevant in the phenomenon of whoosh noise.
From the figure it can be surmised that the pressure signal exhibits its
stronger 3 kHz component at the diffuser and the downstream half of the
blade chords, towards the trailing edges. Color scale needs to be magnified
in order to appreciate the distribution in the volute, which is stronger at its
narrower part near the tongue. The scale needs to be restricted again to see
the pattern at the inlet and outlet ducts, in the form of a standing wave.

Focusing in the diffuser and the wheel, Fig. 6.18 shows a perpendicular
view of the diffuser plane. As it is apparent from the plot, distribution of
the content amplitude is not axisymmetric neither in the diffuser nor in the
wheel, with two opposite zones of the rotor appear to feature higher content
at the selected frequency.

6.4.2. Modal decomposition
However, while the Fourier analysis method allows the obtaining of interesting results in a simple, straightforward way which moreover can be
found already implemented in some commercial CFD codes, it is not without
disadvantages.

Among them is the need to manually select both the surfaces and the
frequencies of interest, thereby having the risk of missing relevant regions
or frequencies, which are not known beforehand. Also, in more complex
geometries or flow structures it could be difficult to pinpoint exactly relevant features, requiring the placement of multiple planes in the domain to
reconstruct these structures.

6.4.2.1. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition
In order to address these limitations, more sophisticated analysis can be
carried out in the form of modal decomposition of the flow field. One of
the most used among these is probably the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) or Karhunen–Loève expansion, which originated in the field of
probability theory and was first applied to the analysis of turbulent flow in
1967 [106] . As (rather poetically) put by Aubry in the aptly named paper
“On the Hidden Beauty of the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition” [107], the
objective of this technique is that:
“The flow is decomposed into both spatial and temporal orthogonal modes
which are coupled: each space component is associated with a time component
partner. The latter is the time evolution of the former and the former is the
spatial configuration of the latter.”
In this way, this decomposition allows the identification of which spatial
structures comprise the most energy of the flow field, which is understood
as the superposition of all modes. The ordering of the contribution of each
mode however, allows in principle a simplified yet meaningful reconstruction
of the flow field. This is realized by diagonalizing the time-averaged spatial
correlation matrix assembled with temporal “snapshots” of the flow, obtained
either numerically or experimentally [108, 109].
Principal drawbacks of this method include that in some cases energy
may not be the most relevant metric in characterizing the relevance of flow
structures [108], and that the use of second-order flow statistics can result
in a loss of information such as phase [107], failing to capture the dynamics
of the coherent structures of the flow [110].
Moreover, while modes resulting from POD exhibit spatial orthogonality,
they can contain multi-frequency temporal content [111, 112]. This means
that a particular flow structure can be excited by different phenomena and
at different frequencies, yet remain spatially coherent in time and thus result
in a higher frequency POD mode.

Linking the spatial structures with a specific phenomena requires, as a
consequence, some guesswork based on prior knowledge of the excitation
mechanisms. A good example of this is the application of POD to the CFD
simulation of an engine manifold presented by Sakowitz [112], where it
can be seen how the first POD mode contains different frequency content
originated from both the engine firing and the valve opening.

6.4.2.2. Dynamic Mode Decomposition
An alternative decomposition technique known as Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) that addresses this shortcoming is also presented in the
same work. A relatively recent technique for modal flow decomposition
[113, 108, 114], DMD is a data-based procedure that aims to extract dynamic
information from only the snapshots of a non-linear system while avoiding
any need for previous knowledge [108].
This is done by computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a linear
model which approximates the underlying dynamics of a system, which may
not be necessarily linear [114]. The DMD modes (eigenvectors) calculated
using this technique represent again coherent spatial structures of the flow, in
this case not necessarily orthogonal but each one featuring a single temporal
frequency [111], in contrast with POD modes. DMD eigenvalues represent
the rates of decay and growth of these modes, along with their associated
frequency.
Evaluation of the relevance of each mode to the dynamics of the system is
usually performed by computing the norm of the mode, although Dahan et
al. reported [115] that in some cases it may be preferable to order the modes
attending to their frequency rather that their norm, as some modes may
feature a growth rate of less than the unity, and thus they may be damped
over time.
Furthermore, another advantage of the DMD and POD techniques is that
it can be proved [108, 110] that processing only subdomain data is possible,
be it this subdomain a small region of the domain or even a projection of
the 3D field into a 2D plane, as no spatial arrangement is assumed by either
method. This is convenient as post-processing can be restricted to an area
of the flow where relevant phenomena are expected, saving computational
effort.

6.4.2.3. DMD implementation
As several variations for implementing a DMD strategy already exist in the
literature only the basic concept originally proposed by Schmid [108] will be
shown in this section. Generally, information on the flow field evolution coming from either numerical simulations or experimental measurements2 will
be naturally presented in a sequence of N vectors vi representing temporal
snapshots that can be gathered in a matrix V:
V1N = {v1 , v2 , . . . , vN }

(6.4.1)

Each snapshot contains a quantity M of scalar flow magnitudes which in
the case of experimental results usually represent the velocity information.
In the case of numerical simulations these snapshots may represent other
useful information such as pressure, species, etc. These snapshots should be
separated by a constant time step ∆t, and are assumed to be linearly related
through a certain matrix A, which is assumed to remain approximately
constant during the time N ∆t spanned by the sequence:
vi+1 = Avi

(6.4.2)

Even if the flow field is non-linear, matrix A will provide a linear tangent
approximation of the dynamic characteristics of the flow. The objective is
now to extract its eigenvalues and eigenvectors which, will be the DMD
eigenvalues and the DMD modes of the flow. Combining both expressions
in matrix form we can write that:
V2N = AV1N −1

(6.4.3)

Where V2N contains snapshots 2 to N and V1N −1 contains snapshots 1 to
N − 1. As M for CFD simulations is usually in the order of 106 and N must
comprise a sensible amount of time steps in order to ensure that the dynamic
characteristics are well captured, directly performing the eigendecomposition of A is usually too computationally expensive.
In order to overcome this problem different strategies exist, such as reformulating 6.4.3 into a companion matrix that can be solved through a QR decomposition [110, 113, 109]. A more numerically stable method however is
to make use of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) [108, 111, 112, 114]
to obtain V1N −1 = UΣW T . Then, 6.4.3 becomes:
V2N = AUΣW T
2

(6.4.4)

For instance, from experimental Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements that
capture a sequence of velocity field snapshots.

From this expression it is now possible to manipulate the terms that are
already known in order to define a new matrix S, which will be thus related
to A in the following way:
S

U T V2N WΣ−1 = U T AU

(6.4.5)

It can be seen that this relationship between S and A matches the definition
of matrix similarity. Thus, S is similar to A and as a consequence their
eigenvalues λi are the same, with the advantage that S is of reduced size
and easier to solve. The DMD modes Φi can finally be calculated from the
eigenvectors yi of S as:
Φi = U yi
(6.4.6)
The frequency associated with each spatial mode can be recovered by
evaluating the imaginary part of each complex eigenvalue, and taking into
account the time step ∆t between snapshots:
fi =

ωi
ℑ{ln(λi )}
=
2π
2π∆t

(6.4.7)

As for ranking the contribution of each mode to the total flow field, several
approaches can be followed. Since many eigendecomposition routines
normalize the eigenvectors [116], simply computing their 2 norm is not
always reliable.
The energy of the modes can be recovered by solving a linear system in
which the DMD-reconstructed field multiplied by unknown amplitudes is
compared against a selected snapshot [116]. It is also possible to optimize
these amplitudes to promote a more sparse reconstruction of the field with
fewer modes [111].
Another ranking metric was considered by Schmid [108] in his original
DMD formulation, based on the computation of the modes’ coherence in
time. This can be done by first calculating matrix G [117]:
G = V1N −1 Σ−1 Y

(6.4.8)

Where Y is the matrix that gathers the eigenmodes yi of S. Then for each
column g∗,i of G, the coherence Ei of each DMD mode Φi can be obtained
as the inverse of its norm:
Ei = ||g∗,i ||−1
(6.4.9)
A disadvantage of this solution for ranking the modes is that the true magnitudes of the vectors for flow reconstruction purposes remain unknown. If
flow reconstruction is desired, for instance aiming to simplify the application

of the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings acoustical propagation procedure [118] as
done by Dahan et al. [115], solving the amplitudes in a reference snapshot
as done by the dymode code [116] or the use of the sparsity-promoting
procedure by Jovanovi´c et al. [111] are recommended instead.

6.4.2.4. Sample DMD results
In order to provide an example of application of DMD to the CFD simulation
considered in this chapter, preliminary work was done by implementing the
original SVD-based DMD procedure with coherence ranking, and applying it
to a limited subset of the available data, specifically to the dynamic pressure
information at cells near the outlet wall.
This was done by taking advantage of the POD/DMD property that allows
the selection of a subdomain instead of the whole domain. Furthermore, data
downsampling was performed both spatially and temporally by considering
one in ten cells and one in ten snapshots, resulting in a spatial length of
M ∼ 7 × 103 and a temporal length of N ∼ 103 .
In Fig. 6.19 the normalized coherence Ei /Emax of each DMD mode Φi
has been plotted, highlighting the top 10 modes with the higher coherence.
An average PSD of the pressure content is also presented, showing a good

agreement with the mode coherence. In both cases the maximum is located
at a frequency f i ∼ 16 kHz, which in the computed modal space corresponds
to mode Φ323 and is related to the blade passing frequency (BPF).
Besides the BPF tonal noise, another relevant DMD mode appears at
approximately half of this frequency (7.6 kHz). Coincidentally, this specific
frequency is similar to the onset frequency of the first asymmetric acoustic
mode (7.4 kHz). At lower frequency (<3kHz) several coherent modes
appear, demonstrating the relevance of this particular frequency band.
The spatial distribution of some DMD modes is plotted in Fig. 6.20. It can
be seen in this figure how the content of the spatial modes is distributed
along the outlet duct. The first three modes of lower frequency (Φ0.8 kHz ,
Φ1.6 kHz and Φ2.1 kHz ) feature a distribution that is related to the plane wave
propagation, with the modes at higher frequency showing a more complex
distribution as a result of the onset of the different acoustic modes.
The influence of mode frequency and acoustic mode propagation in the
distribution of the spatial content of the DMD modes can be seen in Fig. 6.21,
where some DMD modes are selected to showcase this evolution.
In the leftmost plot the mode corresponding to the 0 kHz frequency has
been selected, with the result showing the expected uniform distribution
along the outlet duct (save for some small regions that are probably the
result of numerical error).
As frequency increases a pattern typical of a standing wave starts to appear
in the simulated duct. Note specially the similarity between the distribution
of the Φ3 kHz mode and the magnitude of the FFT in the compressor outlet
duct shown in Fig. 6.17.

When higher order acoustic modes start propagating in the CFD simulation, the pattern changes. DMD mode Φ11.5 kHz shows the effect of the first
asymmetrical mode, denoted as (0,1) in Eriksson’s notation [83], as the
content is no longer homogeneous in each section but dependant on the
angle as well. Finally, mode Φ11.5 kHz features a very complex pattern as
modes (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,0) and (1,1) are propagating at these higher
frequencies.

6.5. Conclusions
In this chapter a numerical simulation of the compressor characterized
in chapter 4 has been validated regarding not only the global operating
variables but specifically taking into account the acoustic point of view, which
is usually not addressed in detail in many works regarding the simulation of
automotive compressors.
It has been shown how the definition of the domain and boundary conditions has a large influence on the spectral information that can be recovered
from the simulation results, by creating spurious reflections and standing
waves that are not present in the experimental setup.

To address this issue while keeping the CFD domain and mesh within the
limits of usual computational capacity the use of pressure wave decomposition has been shown both in numerical and experimental results, allowing
enhanced isolation and recovery of the spectral information coming from
the compressor and filtering spurious interferences.
Selection of the monitor type and location is also crucial from the acoustic
point of view, as it is taking into account the propagation of higher order
modes that may render results that are dissimilar from experimental reference data. Wall-flush pressure monitors demonstrated better agreement
overall with the experimental measurements, although the area-averaged
type of monitor showed better agreement in the outlet at plane wave frequencies, specially regarding the prediction of a “whoosh” frequency broadband
at the operating condition of higher pressure ratio which signals the onset
of marginal surge conditions and the appearance of reversed flow.
Analysis of the pressure and velocity fields simulated by the CFD models
has been shown, in order to identify flow phenomena that may be related
to the increased acoustic output at these unstable operating conditions.
Contours of velocity and pressure at selected planes and surfaces show
rotating low pressure “bubbles” that are linked to the zone of reversed flow,
visualized through null axial velocity isosurfaces.
Inspection of these velocity isosurfaces offers a way of predicting the
evolution of the backflow as operating conditions change. The point of
maximum pressure ratio shows the inception of these backflows in the
periphery of the wheel. At the same time, velocity information from a 50%
isospan surface shows areas of increased velocity in the diffuser near the
volute tongue, except for the case of the higher mass flow case. PSD from
the velocity signal in the diffuser shows a peak at 2.9 kHz accompanied by
two side peaks, which may be related to the “whoosh” phenomenon.
Moreover, vortex shedding from the compressor blades however is detected
in the three simulated conditions, which may be linked to the acoustic
emission as they induce a pressure fluctuation in the channels that is rotating
with the shaft speed.
Further postprocessing techniques to inspect the location of acousticallyrelevant flow features includes the use of the FFT of the pressure signal at
selected spatial locations and frequencies of interest. An example has been
presented regarding the 3 kHz frequency, showing special prominence of
this frequency at the compressor wheel and diffuser.

Finally, in order to avoid the necessity of guessing which are the relevant
frequencies and spatial locations, the use of modal decompositions of the
flow field has been proposed, discussing advantages and disadvantages
of different techniques. A limited-scope example of the formulation and
implementation of the Dynamic Mode Decomposition has been shown, with
the coherence of the model identifying relevant frequencies of the flow and
their associated spatial distribution on the outlet duct wall cells.
While implementation of the DMD technique over the full numerical
domain is outside of the scope of this work, as it requires the implementation
of computational tools to link Star-CCM+ snapshots with outside libraries
that allow the manipulation of data in the order of gigabytes, it has been
shown that further research on this topic could lead to a better identification
of the spatial location of the most relevant frequency components of the
flow field.

CHAPTER 7

Influence of the inlet flow field
As it was seen in the literature review of chapter 2, the inlet flow field
immediately upstream of the compressor wheel has demonstrated a significant influence on parameters such as efficiency, maximum mass flow and
characteristics of the noise output. CFD simulation results have show a
complex flow field when the turbocharger operates in unstable conditions
at the marginal surge region of the map.
While some measurements of flow variables have been performed in these
conditions, they are often limited to a single sensor such as a thermocouple
or pressure transducer, in order to use the reading as a metric for surge
prediction. However, in order to validate CFD results and obtain a deeper
knowledge of this unstable, reversed flow, in this chapter a measurement
campaign is described where the spatial resolution of this phenomenon is
taken into account.

7.1. Local measurements methodology
In this section the methodology used to characterize the reversed flow is
presented, by measuring variables such as temperature, pressure and velocity
at different locations.

7.1.1. Turbocharger modification
Prior to its installation in the gas stand, modifications were made to the
selected compressor in order to accommodate the required local temperature
and pressure sensors used to measure these variables.

129

The compressor housing was modified by removing the original inducer
up to the plane of the blade leading edges and substituting it by a removable adaptor piece which incorporates guides for a circumferential array of
thermocouples and a miniaturized pressure probe. This adaptor is depicted
in red in Figs. 7.1 and 7.2.
A detachable straight pipe section with a linear thermocouple guide was
affixed to this adaptor. This configuration offers the possibility of easily
substituting the straight section for others with different geometries such as
elbows or tapered ducts.

7.1.2. Temperature
It is well established on the literature [119, 95] that flow reversing from
after the impeller is one of the most telling phenomena signalling compressor instability and stall inception. As these backflows are coming from
downstream the wheel they are thus at higher temperature, due to the
non-isentropic compression process.

Consequently, not only pressure but also temperature measurement should
provide a method for characterizing both the inception of these backflows
and their upstream extent. For instance, Liu et al. [44] showed how the
standard deviation of temperature and pressure measurements are good
indicators of deep surge.

the turbocharger (bottom).

Two thermocouple arrays were thus installed on the compressor inlet in
order to characterize the temperature distribution caused by this backflow.
A circumferential array covers a cross section of the pipe just 14 mm from
the compressor wheel plane, providing temperature measurements each
45º. The second array is linear, extending in the longitudinal direction of
the pipe up to approximately 2 inlet diameters. Both arrays can be seen in
Fig. 7.1 and specially in Fig. 7.2.
The first one was intended to tell if angular variations of temperature
distribution existed, and the second one aimed to characterize the length of
the recirculating backflows at each operating condition of the compressor.
Numerical simulations performed by Lang [41] suggested that backflows
extend up to 2–3 diameters in length, with a thickness higher than half a
radius. Andersen et al. [43]. selected a distance of half the duct radius for
placing several thermocouples in the inlet pipe of the compressor, whereas
Figurella et al [29] used thermocouples placed in the centre of the pipes and
a single one at 14mm from the blade tips, protruding 4mm, to characterize
the backflow.
Further measurements of temperature were taken, to provide reference
points for the two arrays. Ambient temperature of the test chamber is
recorded, being the that of the ingested flow. A surface thermocouple was
affixed as well to the external wall of the aforementioned circular array
adaptor.
All of the thermocouple measurements were captured with the same
Yokogawa oscilloscope, and were averaged over one second.
Additionally, a thermographic camera was installed onto the turbocharger
assembly, so that its view frame covered both the compressor volute and its
inlet pipe duct. This provided a measurement of the external distribution
of temperature, that proved useful to validate that the temperature profiles
measured by the linear thermocouple array were not caused by heat transfer
from the inlet pipe walls.

7.1.3. Pressure
While pressure measurements are usually carried out in both inlet and
outlet ducts of the compressor, an effort has been made to characterize
the spectral signature of the pressure in two critical locations: on the inducer, upstream the compressor wheel and on the diffuser, downstream
of the wheel. Miniaturized Kistler type 6055C pressure probes, which are
temperature-compensted up to 350ºC, were used in both locations.

The inducer probe was mounted flush to the wall, at a distance of 6 mm
from the wheel leading edge to the centreline of the sensor. The diffuser
probe was mounted 5 mm from its beginning and 34.5 mm from the turbocharger axis line. Both probes can be seen in Fig. 7.1 and Fig. 7.2.

7.1.4. Velocity
Besides isolated measurements of pressure and temperature, the characterization of the whole flow field is also crucial. Not only for understanding
how the backflows interact with the downstream flow, but also to validate
CFD predictions of macroscopic flow structures.

showing the adaptor piece, the glass tube and the mounting flange.

7.1.4.1. Laser PIV measurements
In order to allow a characterization of these flow fields, a Particle Image
Velocimetry (PIV) system was installed on the anechoic chamber. For PIV
measurements, a laser sheet illuminates the measurement region, previously
seeded with particles, by means of two consecutive laser shots of a Qswitched Nd:YAG laser. These two laser shots, produced at a user-defined
time interval, illuminate the same flow field, so that light scattered by the
particles is collected by a straddle CCD camera in two consecutive frames.

Based in these two frames particle position
can be determined using cross-correlation algorithms. Hence, instantaneous two-dimensional
velocity fields can be computed based on the
displacement of particle groups within a given
interrogation area of the image and the time
step between frames.
Specifically in this study a standard 2D PIV
system by TSI has been used for the measurement of the instantaneous two-dimensional velocity fields. It consists of a double-head 15 Hz
Nd: YAG laser with 135 mJ/pulse @ 532 nm,
a set of mirrors and lenses to drive the laser
into the measurement plane and change the
laser output 5mm circular beam into a laser
sheet with around 1 mm thickness at the measurement section, a 4Mpixel, 12-bit straddle
CCD camera (PowerView Plus 4MP) and a synchronization device. The air flow was seeded
with 1 µm oil droplets from an atomiser using
the Laskin nozzle principle (TSI 9306A Six-jet
atomizer). Figs. 7.3 and 7.4 show the exper- Figure 7.4: Images of the laser

rithms and validation criteria of the TSI Insight
3G software options. Post-processing, graphical output and analysis tools
were complemented with new processing routines developed in MATLAB
for the specific purposes of this work.
The magnification of the images taken was around 30 pixel/mm (in fact,
between 28 and 32 pixel/mm depending on the arrangement) and the size
of the interrogation area for calculation of the cross-correlations was set to
64 × 64 pixels. This leads to the measurement of velocity fields with vectors
separated a distance of 32 pixels, i.e. ∼1 mm. Time elapsed between the
two laser shots was set to a value between 2 and 10 µs depending on the
flow velocities at each test point in the experimental test matrix.
Seeding control was proven to be critical, especially in the case of the
longitudinal measurements that were made through the walls of the glass
pipe.

(top) and an invalid one (bottom) due to oil soiling.

Even during measurements of the longitudinal plane at stable conditions
(high mass flow) where the stalled backflow does not reach upstream the
leading edge of the blades, oil accumulated in the inner wall of the glass
pipe, obstructing the view and enhancing reflections that rendered the
measurement impossible through the affected parts.
Fig. 7.5 shows a raw longitudinal snapshot, detailing how the detrimental
reflections reduced the available region of interest (ROI) in which the velocity
can be resolved. These reflections were mainly caused by the laser sheet
entering and exiting the walls of the glass duct, which are visible in the
image.

The issue was aggravated when the backflow generated by the partially
stalled compressor blades reached the glass pipe. As there is a zone where
the axial velocity is null, oil particles become trapped and start to accumulate,
forming a clearly visible fluid “ring” that blocks the view, as seen in Fig 7.5.
Also, the high transversal velocity forces the particles to impinge onto the
inner wall, forming visible helicoidal tracks along the surface.
As a consequence, a test procedure was followed where the turbo was
settled at the desired operating conditions, and then seeding particles were
introduced during at least 1 s. This allowed approximately 10 usable pairs
of snapshots, after which the turbo was stopped and the glass pipe cleaned
for the next run.
Measurement of the transversal planes was done pointing the camera
directly towards the compressor, thereby avoiding the need to record through
the glass. This allowed for longer test runs because the soiling of the wall
did not affect the measurement.
However, measuring the transversal planes was not without issues. In
this configuration, the rotor blades are illuminated by the scattered light as
shown in the top image of Fig. 7.6, preventing the seeding particles from
contrasting enough to be clearly correlated in some places, and generating
bright spots that are misidentified as particles moving.
In order to mitigate this problem, a system was devised to feed the pulse
train generated by the Hall effect rpm sensor into the laser and camera
trigger controller, so that each pair of snapshots were taken at almost the
same blade position.
This enabled a postprocessing technique where the average intensity of several non-seeded snapshots was subtracted from each seeded image, greatly
reducing the brightness of the illuminated rotor and providing a better particle correlation, as shown in the bottom image of Fig. 7.6. In the case of
the longitudinal measurements, this was not deemed necessary since the
back of the glass was painted matte and thus provided a good background.
While this resulted in overall enhanced quality of the reconstructed field,
small reflections such as that of a small notch at the axis nut could not be
removed. Also, in some occasions small glitches in the operation of the
sensor resulted in pairs where the two laser pulses were included in the first
frame, thereby rendering the pair useless. Fortunately, those cases were easy
to identify and remove.
Since apart from the influence of the background the transverse velocity
flow was much more chaotic than the longitudinal flow field, the quality
of each individual snapshot pair correlation was worse than those of the

longitudinal case as the seeding particles were prone to “lump” together
instead of homogeneously distribute, so only parts of the velocity field could
be solved in each snapshot pair. This effect can be seen in Fig. 7.6.
However, as the oil soiling of the wall was not as problematic, a larger
number of valid pairs could be captured so that the averaged velocity field
could still be solved with confidence.

7.2. Results & discussion
Using both setups, data was captured at several turbocharger operating
conditions. Different shaft speeds were kept constant while air mass flow was
progressively reduced, from a stable operating point close to the compressor
maximum efficiency region to an unstable point very close to the compressor
deep surge limit. Figure 7.7 shows the recorded points for temperature and
pressure measurements. PIV recording points had to be limited due to the
time-consuming procedure required to extract valid data.

In order to prevent the appearance of deep surge, with its inherent danger
to the integrity of the compressor, pressure signals were closely monitored to
account for the onset of very low frequency components (5 to 20 Hz) which
were shown by Galindo et al. [61] to be suitable indicators of deep surge.

Different measurements of temperature were performed in this study: a
radial profile at two selected locations at a single unstable condition, and a
characterization of the circumferential and longitudinal temperature profiles
across the selected region of the compressor map.

7.2.1.1. Radial profile
Before the measurement of the whole map, a sweep of temperature measurements along the inlet radius was performed for both the thermocouple
located at 14 mm and the thermocouple located at 84 mm. For these measurements, the turbocharger compressor was brought to conditions close to
deep surge at 80 krpm.
The results can be seen in Fig. 7.8. As expected, overall temperature
profile is higher at 14 mm from the leading edge plane than at 84 mm.
Temperature seems to be approximately constant up to a distance of 5 mm
from the internal wall, then decaying up to a distance of approximately 10
mm from the centreline (which is at 21 mm from the wall). From there
onwards, temperature is again approximately constant.
Ambient temperature and surface temperature of the adaptor piece (seen
in Figs. 7.1 and 7.2 in red) can also be seen in Fig. 7.8. As expected,
centreline temperature at the most upstream point is almost coincident with
the ambient, while fluid temperatures near the wall at the most downstream
point (at just 14 mm from the wheel) are almost equal to those of the adaptor
piece external wall, save for a small initial difference due to thermal loss.

Figure 7.8: Evolution of temperature measured by the first and last thermocouples of the linear array for different distances from the wall, including
measurements of ambient temperature of the chamber and surface temperature of the adaptor.

From this results it is apparent that measuring the fluid temperature
near the wall is not practical due to the thermal transfer from the wall to
the thermocouple. Standardized procedures for characterization of flow
temperature call for measurements at R/2 and R/3. In this case, this would
correspond to distances of 7 mm and 10.5 mm from the wall. It can be seen
in Fig. 7.8 that those distances show indeed a depart from wall-influenced
temperatures. Ultimately, the distance of R/2 (10.5 mm) was chosen for
this study in accordance with the work of Andersen et al. [43].
Figure 7.8 also shows how even at the core of the flow there is a rise of
temperature of about 8 degrees. It is expected that, even while the hot
backflow is expelled near the walls, its high rotational speed contributes to
the mixing with the cold core flow and the diffusion of the heat, causing the
increase along all the profile.

7.2.1.2. Backflow growth
By analysing the evolution of temperature results over different operating
conditions (speed and air mass flow) it is possible to estimate the growth of
the recirculating backflow.
Figure 7.9 shows different profiles of temperature difference from the ambient, measured by the linear thermocouple array at a same shaft speed and
different mass flows. It can be seen how at higher mass flows the temperature
along the inlet pipe is approximately equal to that of the ambient.
When mass flows is reduced a temperature increase coming from the
compressor wheel starts to be noticeable, denoting the presence of air heated
by the compression process which is reversing in direction due to flow
instabilities on the wheel channels. The operating condition of backflow
onset appears to approximately correspond to that of maximum pressure
ratio at each shaft speed.
Temperature increase grows both in difference from the ambient and distance from the wheel. However, this growth appears to be highly dependent
of the particular shaft speed. At lower shaft speeds, growth reaches greater
distances from the wheel at lower air flows, but maximum temperature
difference is lower. Conversely, at higher shaft speed temperature difference
is greater (due to higher pressure ratio) but backflow extent along the inlet
pipe is more constrained.

Figure 7.9: Evolution of temperature rise measured by the linear array thermocouples for different mass flow settings and different shaft speeds, taking
the most upstream temperature as reference.

The reason for this constriction of backflow length at higher shaft speed
could be probably attributed to higher inlet flow momentum at those operating conditions. Reduced momentum at lower shaft speeds would instead
allow the compressed hot backflow to reach farthest into the inlet line when
backflow occurs.

of shaft speed and different air mass flows, showing the progressive rise of
temperature with diminishing air flow. From left to right 111, 71 and 57 g/s.
White line indicates the temperature profile compared in Fig. 7.11.

In order to ensure that the temperature increase along the inlet pipe measured through the thermocouples is indeed caused by compressor backflow
and not by thermal diffusion from the compressor housing through the
metallic pipe, an additional test run was performed where thermographic
images of the compressor were captured during the measurements, as shown
in Fig. 7.10.
These snapshots were synchronized with the operating conditions at which
flow temperatures were measured inside the duct. Inlet pipe radiated wall
temperature profiles were extracted to compare their growth against those
of the internal flow. Figure 7.11 shows this comparison.
Considering first the higher flow operating condition (blue lines) where
there is no backflow exiting the compressor, it is apparent that while the
wall temperature follows a typical heat diffusion process where the external
wall temperature profile (dotted line) is continuously decaying, the flow
temperature measured by the thermocouples (solid line) remains constant
through the pipe.
When the flow is restricted (orange lines) the backflow can be clearly seen
as the internal thermocouples register a temperature increase up to 1–1.5
diameters upstream. Further upstream of this point the flow temperature
remain equal to the most upstream point, whereas the external wall profile
shows no such clear turning point.
As for the lowest flow condition (red lines) the temperature increase as
measured by the internal thermocouples is higher that the temperature
registered by the thermographic camera, so in this case heat would transfer
from the hot backflow to the walls and not the other way around.

7.2.1.3. Circumferential profile
As previously described, temperature measurements were also recorded
using the circumferential thermocouple array situated at 14mm from the
compressor leading edge. The objective in this case was to characterize the
angular distribution of temperature near the impeller at different operating
conditions.
The result for this study can be seen in Fig. 7.12, where the circumferential
temperature profiles at each measured air mass flow regime are plotted for
the different shaft speeds considered. These air mass flow regimes were
the same previously plotted in Fig. 7.9 where the linear array temperatures
were plotted.
It can be seen that the skewness of the circumferential profile grows with
the reduction of mass flow. At higher flow, skewness is practically zero, the
profile being completely regular as the temperatures remain similar for all
angular positions. However, again at the point of higher pressure ratio, some
skewness starts to appear along with an increase in temperature due to hot
backflow.
As air mass flow is further decreased towards compressor surge limit, both
overall temperature and profile skewness increased. The pattern of the
increased skewness appeared to be similar at all conditions: temperature

Figure 7.12: Evolution of temperature measured by the circumferential array
thermocouples as air mass flow was reduced keeping shaft speed constant. A
polar temperature plot is shown for each speed, colors indicating mass flow
from higher (blues) to lower (reds). Legends for colors at each speed are
available in Fig. 7.9. See Fig. 7.2 for reference position of the compressor
volute.

was higher at angles corresponding to the tongue and the end of the volute,
where its cross-section is larger, and smaller at the angles where the volute
cross-section is still small.
Again, while minimum temperatures (corresponding to higher air mass
flows) remain similar for all shaft speeds and approximately equal to ambient
temperature, maximum temperatures increase with shaft speed. This is
coherent with the backflow being hotter due to increased compression ratio.
However, the increased the angular differences of these maximum temperatures is notable, with almost 20ºC difference between the 90º and the
270º angular positions at the lower air mass flow regime of the 160 krpm
test (red line in the rightmost plot of Fig. 7.12).

7.2.1.4. Temperature compressor maps
In order to visualize how the previously presented temperature results
varied with the compressor operating condition, some selected results have
been mapped to the compressor map presented in Fig. 7.7 through an
interpolation procedure. The result of these mappings can be seen in Fig.
7.13.

Figure 7.13: Evolution of temperature rise measured by the linear array thermocouples for different mass flow settings at 140 krpm, taking the most
upstream temperature as reference.

The leftmost map shows how the skewness of the circumferential temperature distribution varies along the different operating conditions. Standard
deviation has been chosen as a metric to quantify the magnitude of the
skewness. It can be shown in the leftmost map of Fig. 7.13 how skewness
rises with higher shaft speed and instability caused by lower air mass flows.

Figure 7.14: Temperature readings at the inlet linear array for a constant shaft
speed (80krpm) and different mass flows. Circles indicate the estimated limit
of the backflow for each mass flow using the proposed criterion.

Center map of Fig. 7.13 shows the overall maximum temperature measured by the thermocouples. The distribution along the map is similar to
that of the skewness albeit less pronounced at higher speeds. Temperatures
remain close to the ambient temperature (∼20ºC) at higher mass flow and increase after the isospeed slope approaches zero. This increased temperature
can reach up to 80ºC at 160 krpm and conditions close to surge.
Lastly, an estimation of the backflow upstream extent is provided in the
rightmost map of Fig. 7.13. This was done postprocessing the raw data
from the linear array displayed in Fig. 7.9. The temperature profile for
each measurement point (shaft speed and air mas flow) was automatically
processed with the following algorithm:
Starting from the thermocouple closer to the impeller, each thermocouple
reading of the linear array is compared with the ambient temperature; the
first that reads less than 3ºC above is selected as the backflow extent.
The following step checks if the maximum temperature difference between
linear thermocouples is more than 3ºC; if not, a constant temperature profile
has been detected. If the maximum temperature of the profile is less that
10ºC above ambient temperature, backflow length is assumed to be minimum (0.3D), the deviation caused by previous prolonged operation at high

temperature points. If not, it is assumed to be maximum (2D), meaning
a very large backflow. This situation only occurred when the compressor
entered deep surge conditions.
If the profile still does not satisfy the previous criteria, this means that the
backflow is extending beyond the length of the linear thermocouple array,
but it is not so high as being uniform. In this case a linear-log extrapolation
of the measured profile is performed. The backflow maximum length is
assumed to be located where the extrapolated profile intercepts a threshold
of 3ºC above ambient temperature. An example of this processing is shown
in Fig. 7.14.
The resulting map plotted in Fig. 7.13 shows that no backflow is apparent
at higher mass flows, with its length only reaching the thermocouple array
near the point of null slope of the isospeed line. However, contrary to the
case of the previous two maps, backflow length is higher at low shaft speeds,
as lower mass flows provide less momentum to counteract the backflow.

7.2.2. Pressure
Two sets of pressure information were recorded during this experimental
campaign. Local pressure in both inducer and diffuser was acquired in order
to provide more insight into the flow conditions at those areas of interest
and to validate CFD results. In addition, in-duct pressure as recorded by
the piezoelectric arrays in order to compare with this local pressure and to
compute sound intensity by means of the beamforming wave decomposition
procedure.

7.2.2.1. Local pressure
As shown in Figs. 7.1 and 7.2, miniature pressure probes were fitted in both
the inducer and the diffuser of the compressor in order to characterize the
behaviour of the pressure as the operating conditions changed.
In figure 7.15, the top row shows the sound pressure levels spectra for
both inducer and diffuser probes at a certain constant shaft speed of 160
krpm and different air mass flows. The frequency range is 0 to 35 kHz, an
upper bound which is well beyond human hearing range but nonetheless
shows relevant information. As the behaviour at the rest of the tested shaft
speeds was similar, the discussion will be presented only for this condition.
It can be seen in these two plots that pressure spectra in the diffuser (right)
remains approximately constant through the different air mass flow regimes,
with a marked increase only in frequencies below 5 kHz.

Figure 7.15: Top row: pressure spectra at the inducer (left) and diffuser (right)
measured by the local pressure probes at different air mass flows while the
shaft speed was kept constant. Bottom row: pressure spectra at the inlet (left)
and outlet (right) ducts, including the onset of the first and second acoustic
modes.

A broadband noise centered around 2 kHz becomes apparent at low flow
conditions, with two sidelobes. A characteristic Blade Passing Frequency can
be clearly seen as a peak at 16 kHz, along with higher and lower frequency
harmonics. A very notable TCN-like broadband is also present at high
frequency, peaking around 23 kHz and thereby higher than BPF.
Data from the inducer pressure probe on the left top plot, on the other
hand, shows very different spectra depending on the compressor operating
condition. At higher flow conditions, frequency content below 5 kHz is lower
than the rest of the audible content between 5 kHz and 22 kHz. A slight
broadband can be seen peaking around 20 kHz. As the flow is reduced from
120 to 115 and 111 g/s all the frequency content raises in level but the
distribution is similar, with the broadband being more pronounced, but still
peaking around the same 20 kHz frequency.
As seen in Figs 7.13 and 7.9, the next measurement point at 101 g/s is the
first where the hot backflow reaches the first thermocouple at 1/3 diameters
from the impeller. Recall from Fig. 7.2 that the inducer pressure probe is

located between this thermocouple and the impeller, thus the fact that the
backflow is reaching the thermocouple implies that the probe readings are
starting to be affected by this backflow.
This causes a radical change in the pressure spectrum: in contrast with
the previous operating point, at 101 g/s (line colored in teal) the highest
level is now located below at and below 5 kHz with a steady decrease up to
10 kHz and a more or less constant content until level starts to fall after 28
kHz.
As air mass flow was again decreased to 90 g/s, the backflow extended
upstream to at least the second thermocouple at 1 diameter distance from
the impeller leading edges. This changes again the spectrum, with now
the higher levels descending from 0 to 8 kHz, constant level from 8 to
approximately 25 kHz and a broadband peaking at approximately 30 kHz.
The following two operating points where air mass flow was still reduced
(to 78 and 72 g/s) and the backflow keeps extending upstream (as seen in
the thermocouple readings presented in Fig. 7.9) exhibit spectra similar to
the previously described, but with the higher frequency broadband slightly
shifting upwards in frequency up to approximately 32 kHz.
As it was the case with the measurement from the diffuser pressure probe,
the Blade Passing Frequency peak at 16 kHz and its lower and higher frequency harmonics can be clearly distinguished at all operating points.
Lastly, the lower frequency broadband at around 1–3 kHz that is usually
associated with whoosh noise can be clearly distinguished at all mass flow
conditions specially in the inducer spectra, even at the higher flow point
were the backflow still has not reached the probe location. This could
be related to the phenomena observed by Li´skiewicz [120] where some
frequencies characteristic of unstable fluid structures were shown to be
present in damped form even at stable conditions.

7.2.2.2. In-duct pressure
In addition to the miniature pressure probes at the inducer and the diffuser
of the compressor, pressure was also measured by piezoelectric transducer
arrays in the straight inlet and outlet ducts. While these arrays were mainly
used to compute plane wave sound intensity, the spectrum of the first sensor
of each array was plotted in the bottom row of Fig. 7.15 to compare the
pressure signature in the ducts with those measured by the probes.
Comparing the pressure spectra measured in the outlet duct (bottom right
plot) with the previously described spectra measured in the diffuser (top
right plot) it can be seen that the results are similar except for the shifting of

the high frequency broadband, from approximately 23 kHz to 15 kHz. Again,
levels increase with lower mass flow at the lower frequencies and descend
at the higher frequencies, in this case the turning point being around 8 kHz.
BPF peaks are still clearly visible except for the lower frequency harmonic.
Contrasting with the notable differences between the spectra at different
air mass flow conditions that were captured by the inducer probe, the inlet
sensor shows an evolution similar to that of the outlet. A clear increase in
levels can be seen for frequencies lower than 5 kHz as mass flow is reduced,
whereas the levels at higher frequencies remain similar or even diminishing
slightly.
The broadband in this case appears to be centered around 7 kHz, but most
interestingly, in all the spectra this TCN-like broadband collapses with a deep
decrease in level at 5 kHz. Again, by using expression 3.3.7 as proposed by
Eriksson [83] for the onset of the first asymmetric mode, and expression
3.3.8 for the first circular mode, we can estimate their onset frequencies for
the inlet and outlet ducts.
These have marked with grey dotted lines in Fig. 7.15. As it can be seen the
onset of the first mode, and thus the limit of the plane wave range, is around
5 kHz with slight differences due the variation in temperature, diameter and
Mach number from the inlet to the outlet. The TCN-like broadband appears
to be unable to shift lower than this frequency.
While in the case of the inlet duct f a appears to coincide with the abrupt
lower bound of the mentioned TCN-like broadband, it appears that in the
case of the outlet duct the broadband has shifted enough so that its lower frequency limit is higher than f a and thus the broadband content is symmetric,
without the collapse at the plane wave limit observed at the inlet.
However (unlike what previous results of subsection 4.1.1.3 seemed to
suggest) no correlation with the first circular mode is evident in this case. It
becomes thus apparent that while the TCN-like higher frequency broadband
propagates above plane wave conditions, it is not related to the onset of a
certain mode.
As for the pressure probes, both turning points appear to be more related to
the first mode onset at 5 kHz, but specially in the case of the diffuser it should
be taken into account that the given expression for a circular pipe does not
apply and the acoustic modes will depend on the particular geometry of the
compressor.

7.2.2.3. Noise
Following the interpolation procedure described in [5] it is possible to
construct “noise maps” that allow for an easy visualization of how the sound
intensity level in a given band varies with the operating condition of the
compressor. Such maps were calculated for the 1 – 3 kHz, the result shown
in Fig. 7.16.

Figure 7.16: Sound intensity level maps for both inlet (top) and outlet (bottom)
ducts in the 1 – 3 kHz frequency band, interpolated from the measured
operating points.

This band was chosen as it is usually associated with the “whoosh” noise
[23, 22] phenomenon that was discussed in previous chatpters. Indeed,
a broadband peaking around 2 kHz was found specially in the spectra
measured by the inducer and diffuser probes at higher shaft speeds and low
mass flow conditions, as shown in Fig. 7.17.

Figure 7.17: Lower frequency pressure spectra at the inducer (top) and diffuser
(bottom) measured by the local pressure probes at different air mass flows
while the shaft speed was kept constant at 160 krpm.

It can be seen in Fig. 7.16 that sound intensity is higher in the outlet than
in the inlet duct. Also, at higher mass flow where the isospeed curve still is
changing in slope, there are low levels for almost all the shaft speeds. While
in both cases noise levels rise with shaft speed and and lower air mass flow,
distribution is however not the same.

Operating conditions with higher level are more extended in the inlet
duct both in terms of shaft speed and mass flow. Except for the top shaft
speed, noise levels rise sooner in the inlet than in the outlet. Considering for
instance the 140 krpm line, it can be seen that in the inlet, high levels (red
colors) are reached just at approximately 80 g/s whereas in the outlet red
contours are not reached until nearly the deep surge limit at around 60 g/s.
Slope of the sound intensity contours is also different between inlet and
outlet. Level increase is more progressive in the outlet but in the inlet the
increase happens suddenly at mass flows just before to the point where the
backflow reaches the inlet thermocouples.
This suggest that the whoosh broadband noise naturally propagates downstream but the upstream propagation is only boosted when the backflow
extends pass the impeller and into the inlet duct, pointing to the generation
flow mechanism being located after the impeller rather than being caused
by the instabilities of the hot backflow at the inlet duct.

7.2.3. Velocity
Once that temperature data was processed to estimate the backflow extent
across the area of interest of the compressor map, the experimental setup
of the turbocharger was modified to fit the glass pipe that confined this
backflow and the laser optics were installed in order to proceed with the PIV
measurements.

7.2.3.1. Longitudinal plane
As described in the methodology section, longitudinal plane measurements
were the most difficult since the seeding oil particles blocked the line of
sight of the camera. However with the right combination of seeding flow,
oil dilution and quick operation of the system, valid snapshot pairs were
obtained.
In order to capture the difference between stable and partially stalled
conditions (also called mild surge or marginal surge conditions) two backpressure valve positions were tested, while maintaining the same shaft speed
of 140 krpm.
PIV postprocessing was carried out for 7 snapshot pairs for each condition.
This was the maximum snapshots that could be recorded before the oil film
ring shown in Fig. 7.6 started to form at the stagnation zone of the backflow
in the unstable condition test, obscuring the images.

While the lower third of the frames were obscured by a reflection, at least
of the longitudinal plane could be resolved in sufficient quality. The two
resulting averaged velocity fields can be seen in Fig. 7.18.
In these tests there was no direct measurement of inlet air mass flow, so
an average of the measured velocity field in the upstream area of the duct
was taken to identify the precise operating point of the compressor.
At the higher mass flow, it can be seen that the velocity field is approximately homogeneous along the duct and only near the wall the velocity
diminishes. However, when flow is reduced, the spatial distribution of velocity changes. The expected compressor backflow is apparent as the low
velocity region near the wall increases in thickness, reducing the useful
diameter from ∼19 mm to ∼13 mm.

at high and low flow. Solid line indicates the mean and points correspond to
individual snapshot pairs. Pair 18 is presented separately as it starts showing
the effect of the oil fouling. Note that distances below 10 mm are obscured
by the adaptor piece.

This apparent reduction in velocity magnitude is probably caused by the
highly transversal velocity of the backflow, that makes the transit time of
the particles through the laser sheet too small to be captured in consecutive snapshots and thus makes the correlation impossible so no velocity is
detected.
The reduction in diameter extends to approximately ∼55 mm, this is,
approximately half of the transparent glass length. This distance is consistent
with the prediction made through temperature measurements as shown in
the backflow length map of Fig. 7.13, which is included for convenience.
It can also be seen in Fig. 7.18 how this reduction in the useful diameter
appears to be paired with an increase in the flow velocity. A similar but
lower increase can be seen in the work of Fike et al. [52] in a single channel
of an axial flow fan.
A similar constriction and acceleration of the flow is correctly predicted
by the compressor numerical model developed by Lang [41].
To better quantify the increase in speed in the core flow, velocity data
along the turbocharger axis line (marked with dashed line in Fig. 7.18)
from each valid snapshot has been plotted in Fig. 7.19 for both operating
conditions. The first invalid snapshot pair has also been plotted (black dots)
to show how the oil film accumulating in the pipe wall due to the backflow
starts to affect the measurements.

In order to assess if the flow field is stationary enough so that this approximate number of snapshot pairs accurately reflects the velocity profile, in
Fig. 7.20 the profiles shown in Fig. 7.19 have been recreated for different
consecutive snapshot sets taken during the same measurement run. Note

Figure 7.20: Velocity magnitude averages over the centreline of the longitudinal plane at high and low flow, considering different consecutive sets of
snapshots.

It can be seen that for the higher flow rate case (right) where conditions
are stable, the calculated velocity profile is approximately the same for any
snapshot range, showing that the flow field is not changing from one set
to the next. In the case of the unstable conditions however, this coherence
only holds true for the part of the pipe which is upstream of the backflow
stagnation point.
As oil starts accumulating (in snapshot pair 18 as seen in Fig. 7.19) velocity
readings diminish until the point that almost no velocity can be measured
(last two sets of snapshots). Further downstream of the oil ring velocity
readings tend to recover to the same point.
Looking then at the selected pairs (10–17) in Fig. 7.19 it can be observed
how, while at higher flow rate the flow exhibits an approximately constant
velocity along the line (which only decreases adjacent to the axis nut) at the
lower flow condition and after a steady initial segment the velocity increases
to a top average speed of 91.7 m/s. The average speed at the initial segment
between 80 and 90 mm was found to be 43.7 m/s.

Using this data it is possible to draw a simple correlation between the area
constriction and the increase of speed. By applying the mass conservation
equation between the initial segment (denoted by the subscript 1) and the
top speed point (denoted by the subscript 2):
˙ 1 = m˙2 = ρ1 U1 πr12 = ρ2 U2 πr22
m

(7.2.1)

If a small enough increase of temperature between point 1 and point 2
is assumed so that ρ1 ∼ ρ2 the expression can be rearranged to obtain the
velocity change:
r22
U1
= 2
U2
r1

(7.2.2)

If now the aforementioned approximate values for radii and velocities are
substituted into the equation, we can obtain an estimation of the relative
error between the theoretical value and the experimental observation:

(%) =

U1 /U2 − r22 /r12
r22 /r12

· 100 ≈ 1.7%

(7.2.3)

The small relative difference between the prediction and the observation
supports the assumption that the measurement technique is in fact able to
characterize the reduction in useful area associated with the backflow and
its associated increase in velocity, even if the axial speed of backflow itself
cannot be quantitatively measured.

7.2.3.2. Transversal plane
After the measurement of the axial velocity field at the longitudinal plane,
the setup was modified to measure transversal planes. The camera was
moved to point directly through to the compressor short inlet pipe, while
the cylindrical lenses were rotated 90º to create a vertical laser sheet.
During this test, the contrast between a high flow and a low flow operating
condition was again measured as in the transversal test, in order to ensure
that the method allowed for a clear differentiation between the backflow
coming from downstream the impeller and the unperturbed, non-rotating
flow coming upstream from the compressor.

As mentioned earlier, in contrast with the longitudinal case, the background
of the snapshots for these transversal measurements had to be necessarily
the rotating, polished turbocharger impeller itself instead of the back of the
glass pipe. This caused an increased amount of bright reflections that made
tracking of the seeding particles more difficult.
To reduce the severity of this issue, snapshots were synchronized with the
blades’ position through the existing shaft speed Hall effect sensor. However,
the data transfer rate of the particular camera used in this test limited the
time between snapshots and thus the shaft speed at which the synchronization mechanism operated correctly. A speed of 100 krpm was selected as a
compromise between safe operation of the synchronization mechanism and
adequate expected length of the backflow.
Using this setup a first test was carried out where the transversal plane
illuminated by the laser sheet was located at approximately 50 mm (or 1.2
inducer diameters) from the compressor impeller leading edges, since at
this distance it was expected to adequately capture the backflow.
Approximately 90 valid snapshots pairs were captured for both the low flow
and the high flow operating conditions. Since in this case the accumulation
of oil along the walls of the duct was not such a relevant issue, they were
all averaged after subtracting a reference background image made from the
average of 10 snapshots pairs captured before the seeding started as shown
in Fig. 7.6. The results of this process are shown in Fig. 7.21.
In this figure, the two operating conditions are marked on a compressor
map that estimates the length of the hot backflow. As expected, the transversal velocity at the high flow case is low, albeit some reflections from the
impeller blades are showing up in the correlation.
For the low flow rate case, which makes the compressor operate at a
condition where a high backflow is expected, a clearly different flow field
can be observed.
In this case there was a highly rotational field near the walls that diminishes
in the direction of the core flow, coherent with the backflow coming back
through the stalled tips of the impeller blades and through the tip clearance
itself.
As expected, the laser PIV postprocessing method cannot resolve the flow
field up to the glass pipe wall, as there is a small zone where the correlation
does not give valid results, since the rectangular grid does not contain
enough seed particles as they are slowed down by the boundary layer and
obscured by the wall reflection.

After attesting that the experimental setup was able to capture the rotating
backflow, a final test was made where the turbocharger was kept at an
approximately constant low flow operating condition and the laser sheet
was placed at different distances along the glass inlet pipe in order to measure
how the backflow-induced rotational field evolved along the pipe.
The selected operating condition was again at 100 krpm of shaft speed and
a low flow point similar (but not equal) to that of Fig. 7.21. Three different
snapshots sets were taken with the laser sheet at distances of 20, 45 and 85
mm from the leading edges of the impeller blades. Expected length of the
compressor backflow at these conditions was around 70 mm. The results of
this study can be seen in Fig. 7.22.
In this figure, two of the slices (left and center) are inside the backflow as
expected by the temperature measurements discussed before, while the third
one (on the right) is clearly situated outside the backflow as the rotational
velocity is almost null.

slices at different distances from the compressor impeller leading edges. From
left to right 20, 45 and 85 mm. Same compressor operating condition for all
slices.

It is also apparent that the slice closest to the impeller (20 mm) exhibits
a thicker zone of stronger rotational velocity, starting from the wall and
diminishing towards the centre. A reflection coming from a dent in the axis
nut (probably for balance) and some slight reflections from the blades are
also visible.
The second slice at 45 mm from the leading edges features a similar velocity
field, albeit a slight reduction in both the speed and the thickness of the
backflow is appreciable. The effect of erroneous reflections from the blades
is also stronger in the core flow section.

To quantitatively compare the velocity profiles of the three slices, velocity
magnitude data was extracted from the horizontal centreline of each slice.
Fig. 7.23 shows the velocity data for each individual snapshot (points) and
the averaged magnitude (solid line).

Solid line indicates the mean and points correspond to individual snapshot

Dispersion at each point of the line is much higher that in the previously
discussed case of longitudinal plane measurements, but it can be confirmed
that in average the 45 mm slice presents lower top speed and less thickness:
any given speed (for instance, 50 m/s) is achieved closer to the wall than in
the 20 mm slice.
In the case of the 85 mm slice which as predicted was located outside of the
backflow, velocity and dispersion are much lower, the profile being constant
at an approximate magnitude of 4 m/s, probably due to pure momentum
diffusion upstream.
Core rotation velocity appears to be similar in the three measured slices,
at least at radius of less than 8 mm, although the reflections of the blades
and the axis nut introduce some perturbations in the 20 and 45 mm slices.
On the other side, velocity could not be resolved at locations with radius
greater than 20 mm, leaving a gap of missing data of about 1.5 mm from
the pipe wall.

7.2.4. Correlations
As all the captured temperature, pressure and velocity data has been gathered using the same compressor and equivalent straight inlet ducts, some
correlations of interest can be drawn between the different variables.

7.2.4.1. Backflow and sound intensity

1-3 kHz Sound Intensity Level [dB]

In order to further attest for a linkage between these inlet flow instabilities
at marginal surge conditions and the whoosh broadband noise at supersynchronous frequencies, it is possible to correlate the aforementioned
thermal phenomena with total sound level in that frequency range.
Figure 7.24 shows a plot of inlet sound intensity level against standard
deviation of temperature in the circumferential thermocouple array. It can
be seen how for higher temperature deviation sound intensity appears to be
correlated following an ascending trend.
However, below approximately 1.1◦ C of deviation sound level appears to
still increase with shaft speed and lower mass flow, even if no hot backflow
is being detected by the circumferential thermocouple array.

distribution, thereby suggesting a link between the two phenomena.

Figure 7.25: Correlation between standard deviation at the circumferential
thermocouple array and maximum temperature measured by the thermocouples. Size indicates shaft speed from low to high and color indicates mass
flow from higher (blues) to lower (reds).

Coupled with the fact that the increase in sound level happens even at
operating conditions at which the backflow containing the skewness has not
reached the thermocouples yet, this again points to the generation of whoosh
happening in or after the impeller, with the phenomena being amplified
upstream the impeller as the backflow extends into the inlet.
Another linear correlation was performed between circumferential standard deviation of temperature and maximum temperature of the backflow,
as shown in Fig. 7.25. The good agreement of this correlation showed that a
relative or dimensionless standard deviation (this is, raw standard deviation
divided by a representative temperature) is approximately constant: the
backflow is skewed similarly along the compressor map and is augmented
linearly with the increase of temperature caused by higher pressure ratios.

7.2.4.2. Velocity and temperature profiles
Besides using the thermocouples described in section 7.1.1 for estimating
the backflow extent across the different operating conditions, a comparison
was performed between the recorded temperature profiles and the velocity
profiles obtained through PIV.
First a velocity profile was extracted from the longitudinal plane at a line
separated 1/2 radius from the wall, which was the distance at which the
thermocouples were installed. This velocity magnitude profile was then
normalized between 0 and 1, and the same was done with the thermocouple
array data that most closely matched the operating point at which the PIV
test was performed. The results can be seen in the top plot of Fig. 7.26.
In addition to the temperature profile and the averaged value of the velocity
magnitude, error bars indicating the standard deviation values are included.
Contrasting with Fig. 7.19 where the centerline profile was shown to
have a relatively small dispersion, at the thermocouple array location (half
a radius from the wall) the profile suffers from a much larger deviation at
locations where the velocity increases towards the compressor.
Compared with the normalized longitudinal temperature profile measured
by the thermocouple array however, it can be seen that there is a good
agreement in the maximum extent of the backflow influence on velocity and
temperature, with the turning point located around 1.3 diameters from the
impeller and velocity and temperature then increasing towards the impeller.
To compare the radial profile of the backflow in terms of velocity and
temperature, a test was performed where the turbocharger was kept at
a certain fixed operating condition while the thermocouple closer to the
impeller was progressively inserted into the air stream, from close to the
wall to the centerline. Again, data was normalized so that both variables
ranged between 0 and 1. The results can be seen in the bottom plot of Fig.
7.26.
In this case the concordance between temperature and transversal velocity
profiles is even better than in the axial case: near the wall there is a small
section where temperature and velocity are maximum and then both diffuse
towards the center, reaching a stable value corresponding approximately to
the core flow at ±1/4 of the radius away from the centerline.
When instead of focusing into the average velocity values the standard
deviation (represented with bars in Fig. 7.26) of velocity between the
selected snapshot datasets is compared, other interesting findings emerge.

Figure 7.26: Normalized profile comparison between temperature measurements and PIV results on both the transversal plane (bottom plot) and the
longitudinal plane (top plot).

In the case of the transversal velocity field the deviation remains quite
high along the entire profile except for a reduction near the center, since as
previously explained perturbations from the blades in the background and
seeding particles lumping together have a higher impact on each individual
snapshot. Averaging a large number of them correctly estimates the average
velocity but the deviation remains high.

On the other hand, the evolution of the velocity standard deviation in the
case of the longitudinal profile shows a clear difference between a very low
standard deviation upstream and a significant increase in standard deviation
downstream and towards the impeller, which seems well correlated with
the increase in temperature caused by the backflow.
In Fig. 7.27 the spatial distribution of standard deviation has been plotted,
showing how its increase is related to the backflow-affected zone. The
location of the linear array thermocouples has been added, along with the
path of the standard deviation profile selected.
In Fig. 7.28, the same longitudinal temperature profile is depicted along
the normalized magnitude of the velocity standard deviation. A very good
match between the two distributions is obtained this way, further attesting
how the hot reversed flow boosts the variability and complexity of the
velocity field near the compressor impeller at unstable working conditions.
This conclusion is in line with the results of Liu et al. [44] who successfully
showed how the standard deviation of temperature, pressure and mass
flow measured at selected locations abruptly increased near deep surge
conditions. Now, it is possible to link these increases to the properties of
the velocity field measured by PIV, showing how the backflow extends the
deviation as it progresses further upstream.

7.3. Conclusions
In this chapter, an experimental study is described with the objective of
accurately characterizing the behaviour of the inlet flow instability of a turbocharger compressor when marginal surge conditions are reached. Specifically, focus has been put on the high-temperature compressed flow that
reverses direction and extends upstream of the impeller and into the final
section of the inlet duct when marginal surge conditions are reached.
The rotation, vortex shedding and reintegration of this backflow into the
main flow coming through the core of the inlet duct have been regarded
as possible sources of acoustic noise and several methods such as ported
shrouds and different casing treatments have been proposed to mitigate its
occurrence and extension [121, 122].
During this investigation the setup described in section 7.1.1 has been
used to measure the distribution of temperature associated with marginal
surge, this is, conditions with low air mass flow but not as low as to cause
that the compressor goes into deep surge.
By using the two thermocouple arrays installed into the compressor inlet,
both axial and circumferential temperature measurements were obtained
for several operating conditions. A test was also performed in order to characterize the radial distribution of temperature caused by the hot backflow.
The robustness of these internal flow measurements against radiation from
the inlet pipe walls was verified through external thermographic imaging.

The analysis of these temperature distribution allowed the identification of
the backflow length along the compressor chart, together with the maximum
temperature rise in the inlet and also the skewness of the circumferential
temperature distribution of the flow.
Mass flow rate has been shown to be the most influencing factor when
predicting how far the hot backflow extends upstream of the compressor
impeller. At high rotational speeds, where surge occurs at high mass flows,
the backflow temperature is higher (due to higher compression ratio) but the
length of the backflow is shorter. As for circumferential skewness, it has been
shown to increase linearly with backflow temperature, while it appears to be
similar in relative terms for all the different operating conditions considered.
In order to gain further understanding of the generation and evolution
of the local flow behaviour, miniaturized pressure probes where placed
in the compressor inducer and diffuser. Analysis of the data provided by
these two probes, and specially by the former, showed that the pressure
spectral information in the inducer abruptly changed when the backflow
reached the upstream side of the impeller and the probe, as predicted with
the aforementioned temperature data.
Whoosh noise humps are detected at their usual frequencies, along with a
higher frequency TCN-like broadband which features large shifts in frequency,
that could be related to the change in sound speed due to the large difference
in thermodynamic conditions at the selected measurement locations. The
shift of this broadband, however, appears to be limited by the plane wave
frequency.
Furthermore, a correlation of sound intensity in the “whoosh” characteristic
frequency band that was analyzed in previous chapters and the increase
in temperature skewness due to the backflow was found. Comparison of
inlet and outlet sound intensity charts shows a more smooth evolution in
the outlet and a more sudden rise in the inlet, linked to conditions where
the backflow starts to appear.
In conjunction with the analysis of inlet temperature and pressure data,
this suggests that whoosh noise in the inlet is boosted by the convective
effect of the reversed flow structures at the inlet in marginal surge conditions,
but it is not caused by them. Still, strategies aiming at the control of these
backflow structures could influence noise transmission to the downstream
side and potentially alleviate its adverse effects on vehicle NVH perception.
A following experimental effort was carried out with the objective of
measuring the reversed flow at the turbocharger compressor in unstable
conditions when this backflow is confined and fully developed in a straight

duct. In order to do this, the straight duct containing the thermocouples was
substituted with a transparent glass pipe in order to allow the illumination
of the seeded flow with a laser sheet and the imaging of the particles with a
camera.
First, an attempt was made to measure the axial velocity field by imaging a
longitudinal plane introducing the laser sheet aligned with the turbocharger
axis and positioning the camera in a perpendicular way so that images would
be captured through the glass duct.
This proved difficult as the oil particles deposited into the walls of the
duct, obstructing the view of the camera and enhancing the detrimental
reflections that made the correlation difficult or even impossible in some
areas. The effect was found to be even worse when conditions close to
surge were reached, as the highly rotational backflow forced the oil particles
into the walls and also created an stagnation zone where particles formed a
liquid film ring.
As a result of these issues, few valid snapshots of the longitudinal plane
could be captured, leading to the conclusion that further research of other
seeding mechanisms (such as the alumina dispersion used by Wernet [48] or
the fluorescent particles used by Wu et al. [51]) or other coating of the pipe
(such as the fluorescent coating used by Gancedo et al. [60]) is required if a
larger number of snapshots is required.
In any case, the increase of core speed resulting of the reversed flow along
the periphery predicted by Lang’s simulations [41] was observed, and shown
to be coherent with the apparent reduction in useful diameter and also with
prior temperature measurements.
Comparison with higher mass flow rate conditions leads to the conclusion
that the difference between an stable axial flow field and the unstable one
caused by reversed flow in a confined pipe can be characterized through PIV,
albeit with difficulty.
A similar comparison between unstable and stable working conditions was
performed in the transversal plane, keeping the distance to the impeller
equal in both cases. Again a clear difference was observed with a highly
rotational flow appearing at unstable conditions.
To test that transversal plane measurements can be used as well to estimate
the length that the backflow reaches when confined in a straight pipe, an
experiment was performed measuring three “slices” of the flow field: two
inside the predicted length of the backflow and one outside.

This experiment successfully showed a clear difference between the transversal flow field directly caused by the highly rotating backflow and the relatively
unaffected field upstream, allowing the conclusion that this slicing method
can be successfully used to externally characterize the length and radial
distribution of a confined backflow without perturbation as long as images
can be captured from the inlet.
Regarding difficulty, measurements in this transversal planes were easier as
the images could be captured directly through the inlet pipe mouth instead
of through the glass, thereby avoiding the oil fouling problem. However, a
higher ensemble of snapshot pairs was needed since the seeding particles
tended to lump together and leave gaps in each snapshot.
Finally, a comparison between the PIV results and the previous temperature
measurements was performed in order to ensure that both methods were
in agreement. Measurements were normalized in order to meaningfully
compare the profiles.
Comparison of the radial profile was done extracting data from the slice
closer to the compressor, and the closer thermocouple was introduced step
by step into the flow until the inlet duct axis. A good agreement between the
two results was found, reinforcing the conclusion that the high transversal
speed profile measured by PIV is caused by the hot reversed flow and it is
accurately capturing its velocity distribution.
Comparison in terms of axial velocity profile was also performed. While
the non-disturbed upstream flow and the maximum length of the backflow
appeared to match, profiles inside the backflow were more different than
in the transversal case, probably due to the aforementioned difficulties
regarding the PIV measurement through the glass in the presence of confined
backflow.
However if the standard deviation of the recorded snapshots is analyzed,
a good agreement can be found between the rising in deviation and the
raising in temperature.
In conclusion, it has been shown that PIV measurements can be used to
successfully characterize the flow field in the presence of a confined backflow
in the compressor inlet, with the added advantage of avoiding the disturbances that thermocouples or other sensors can introduce. Temperature
measurements with thermocouple arrays can be used to measure the extent
of this backflow and also characterize its circumferential distribution, which
presents good correlation with the increase in whoosh noise levels.

Future works using the flow field characterization techniques presented in
this chapter would be useful in order to visualize the effect of different inlet
configurations designed to mitigate unstable flow issues such as guiding
vanes, tapered ducts, nozzles, etc. and to provide better validation of CFD
simulations.

CHAPTER 8

Influence of the inlet geometry
As discussed in the literature review performed in chapter 2, different geometric variations of the inlet line near the impeller have been proposed and
tested in order to mitigate the negative effect of the flow unstabilities.
While mainly aimed at obtaining a more stable flow to delay deep surge
onset to enhance the usable zone of the map and keep compressor thermodynamic efficiency even at low air mass flow operating conditions, the
impact of these solutions in the generated and transmitted noise must be
also considered.
In this chapter different experimental measurement campaigns are described, where some of the geometries most commonly proposed in the
literature were tested both in the continuous flow test rig and in real engine
conditions.

8.1. Simple geometries
The first of these experimental campaigns was carried by manufacturing a
sample of each one of the simplest proposed geometries: a 90º sharp elbow,
a tapered duct, and a reservoir. In addition, a short straight pipe was also
used as a reference. All of these four geometries can be seen in Fig. 8.1.
These simple geometries were installed on the anechoic chamber flow test
rig described in chapter 3. Both the orifice noise measurement free-field
microphone and the radiated noise setup with four equally distributed freefield microphones were kept in order to evaluate the acoustic emission in
this preliminary investigation.

Figure 8.1: Drawing of the selected simple geometries during the manufacturing process. The straight pipe at the top was used standalone as a reference
and also attached upstream of each geometry in order to measure the instantaneous pressure except for the tapered duct that used a wider pipe.

In order to simulate more realistic inlet conditions a short straight pipe
was added upstream of each tested geometry. This short pipe included a
three piezoelectric sensor array in order to obtain validation pressure data
for CFD simulations, but no acoustic intensimetry could be performed as the
pipes were too short for proper flow development.

8.1.1. Surge margin
Furthermore, raw pressure data from one of these fast sensors was used to
characterize with high precision the air mass flow at which the compressor
entered into deep surge conditions. In this way not only the acoustic output
of each geometry could be measured but also their influence regarding
the stability of the flow and thus the enlargement of the usable operating
conditions.
As in the previously described experimental campaigns, this fast pressure
data was recorded by a Yokogawa digital oscilloscope, along with the mass
flow and shaft speed data. The rest of the ancillary information about the
turbocharger operation was recorded by the in-house DAQ system.
Measurements with each inlet geometric variant were carried out at different air mass flow settings and a constant shaft speed of 160 krpm, from
higher mass flow to lower mass flow.

When conditions were judged to be close enough to deep surge, a continuous recording of the variables started where the mass flow was gradually
decreased by slowly closing the backpressure valve until the violent oscillations of deep surge began and the valve was opened completely to stabilize
the turbocharger.

Figure 8.2: Non-dimensional pressure recording of each geometry when air
mass flow was progressively decreased until deep surge condition was reached.

This pressure recording was then post-processed following a procedure
similar to that described in chapter 3. In steps of 0.5 s, FFT was applied to
obtain the pressure spectra and then a frequency ratio R f was computed
between the power at 0–50 Hz and the power at 50–100 Hz:
Rf =

(8.1.1)

When this power ratio reached values over 100, it was considered that
deep surge had started at that time. Data was then averaged between the
two previous time steps in order to obtain the corresponding value of lowest
allowable air mass flow. Time steps and power ratios can be together with
non-dimensional pressure tracks in Fig. 8.2. The lowest allowable mass flow
obtained through this method can be seen in Fig. 8.3.

Figure 8.3: Lowest allowable air mass flow for the different simple geometries
tested, obtained through the described algorithm.

As seen in this figure, the straight duct is the first one to reach deep surge
conditions. The tapered duct and the 90º elbow pipe have similar but higher
margins until surge, while the reservoir delays this damaging condition even
more, allowing approximately 10 g/s of further air mass flow reduction.

8.1.2. Noise levels
In addition to the effect on surge margin, the effect on external noise levels
was evaluated. As described in previous chapters, two different measurements systems were available in the anechoic chamber.
To capture the orifice noise, one free-field omnidirectional microphone
was situated at a distance of 10 mm from the inlet opening. In this case the
microphone had to be repositioned each time the geometry was changed as
they had different lengths and, in the case of the elbow, orientation of the
orifice.

The second system for measuring externally radiated noise, consisting in
the four equispaced free-field microphones placed at 1 m distance form the
center of the inlet assembly was kept in the same place for all the tested
geometries.
In both cases the microphones were calibrated using a Brüel & Kjær pistonphone prior to the measurements and data was captured using a PULSETM
DAQ system. Fig. 8.4 shows the result of both measurements at the stable
operating point most close to surge as characterized by the aforementioned
procedure, since it is the point of maximum noise emission.

Figure 8.4: Comparison of orifice noise and averaged radiated noise measured
in the anechoic chamber for each of the simple inlet geometries at the stable
operating point most close to surge.

It can be seen that again there are significant differences between the
inlet geometries tested. These differences were higher when measuring
the radiated noise through the average of the four microphones, with the
reservoir featuring a 3 dB reduction compared to the reference straight duct.
On the other hand, the 90º elbow inlet reached a 5 dB increase over the
straight inlet level, but this particular result could be influenced by the fact
that the direction of the orifice was not perpendicular to the plane of the
four microphones. Finally, the tapered duct seemed to radiate at the same
level that the straight pipe.
Regarding orifice noise, the reservoir featured again a reduction in noise
level of 2 dB. However, in this case the elbow featured the same level as the
reference straight pipe, being the tapered duct the one with a higher level
at 130 dB, 3 dB more than the reference geometry.

In Fig. 8.5 the different spectra recorded by the orifice microphone during
each geometry test are plotted to look in detail at these level differences.
It can be seen how levels for the tapered duct are higher along the whole
frequency range, while the inlets featuring the elbow and the reservoir
remain closer to the reference straight pipe.

The most noticeable difference however, is the resonator effect of the
reservoir, that provides an important attenuation at frequencies in the plane
wave region of the spectrum. Compare this against the tapered duct spectrum
which raises levels over the whole spectrum. Finally, a small peak can be
noticed at 16 kHz, correspondent to the Blade Passing Frequency associated
to the 160 krpm shaft speed that was used during these measurements.

8.2. On-engine tests
In the scope of the on-engine tests described in chapter 5, a follow-up
experimental campaign was carried out in order to characterize the effect
that different geometric variations of the turbocharger inlet line had in
performance, surge margin and noise emission.

8.2.1. Measurement setup
The selected geometric variations of the inlet line were chosen taking into
account realistic packaging size restrictions of commercial vehicles, so in
this case the reservoir case was not tested as it was not possible to fit it to
the available compressor inlet.
Similarly, elbow inlets were not tested as they would require to re-route
the inlet line, being its design already frozen at the time of the testing. Focus
was then put into small changes like tapered ducts, rotation devices and
nozzle-like additions to the inlet pipe.

Figure 8.6: Longitudinal section view of the inlet geometries that were considered for the on-engine experimental campaign.

Figure 8.6 shows the selected geometry variations based on these selection
criteria. On top of the figure the reference geometry is depicted. The
turbocharger inducer was milled and substituted by an adaptor to which
a straight duct was coupled. At the end of this duct a pipe of the original
diameter was then affixed with a tapered transition.
The simplest inlet geometry tested consisted in a tapered duct situated as
close as possible to the compressor impeller leading edge. This can be seen
at the center left in the figure. Below, it is shown how this tapered duct was
complemented with an inlet guide vanes (IGV) device.

This was done in order to increase the swirl
of the incoming air flow. The device stators featured 0º leading edge angles and ∼ 70º trailing
edge angles, and it was directly 3D-printed from
the CAD design. The device can be seen fitted
into the inlet pipe in Fig. 8.7.
To analyze how the closeness of the tapered
duct to the impeller influenced the behaviour
of the compressor, the two following geometric variations (center column of Fig. 8.6) were
the same except for the separation between the

it.
Lastly, two nozzles were tested (right column
of Fig. 8.6): a convergent-divergent nozzle between the tapered adaptor and
the impeller (top) and a convergent nozzle (bottom) just after the tapered
duct, with its throat as close as possible to the impeller wheel.
In order to evaluate the influence of these geometric variation on the
noise output of the compressor, the acoustic measurement setup used in
chapter 5 was maintained, consisting in the straight inlet extension featuring
the pressure decomposition array for in-duct intensimetry and the intensity
probe aligned with the inlet orifice.
Measurement operating conditions for the noise characterization campaign
were chosen as to be representative of the most common real-life conditions.
This was done in order to test if these simple inlet variations could modify
the noise output not only on the most extreme conditions but also when
more conservative settings are applied.

8.2.2. Results
Since the objective of this experimental campaign is the comparison between
geometries, in this subsection only the results from the orifice intensity probe
will be presented for the sake of brevity, as it was shown in section 5.3 that
they were well correlated with in-duct noise.
In Fig. 8.8 the interpolated intensity level map is presented, indicating the
points at which each measurement was made. The interpolation of sound
intensity was performed between frequencies of 1 and 3 kHz, which are
specially relevant regarding the aforementioned “whoosh” issue.

Note as well that because of the particular regulation mechanism of the
facility based on the injection of compressed air into the inlet line, the
depicted operating conditions do not represent constant shaft speed lines,
so no judgement about the slope of these lines should be made.
However, it can be seen in this figure that the noise levels in the selected
band behave as expected, based on results described in previous chapters.
Noise levels increase as pressure ratio increases and air mass flow diminishes,
with the dependency on air mass flow being much more noticeable at higher
pressure ratios that at lower ones.
Figure 8.9 shows the results for the same frequency band when the reference straight duct was substituted by each of the variants described in
Fig. 8.6.
It is apparent from the figure that different operating conditions were
measured in each one of the tests, as the goals in this campaign were to
characterize the sound emission across the selected map region and to test
how each geometry impacted the performance in regards of surge margin
and maximum ingested air mass flow.
In this regard, the figure shows how the geometry changes have an impact
on surge margin (left frontier of the map), as some of the modified inlet
lines increase the range of low flow operating conditions that can be safely

Inlet geometry configuration

Figure 8.10: Comparison of mean sound intensity level for each of the inlet
geometries across the normal operating range of the engine.

Impact of the geometry variation on air mass flow was also tested in regards
of maximum flow at 160 krpm, as it is not only important to increase surge
margin but also to maintain the possibility of operating the turbocharger at
high mass flow levels.
A comparison of the performance of each geometry in both aspects is
presented in Fig. 8.10 where the percentages of improvement from the
straight duct reference inlet are plotted. An inverse correlation between
maximum flow and surge margin is apparent, only the tapered duct at 52
mm from the impeller improving both factors at the same time and only the
tapered duct closer to the impeller and featuring an IGV worsening both.
Largest amount of surge margin improvement was found with the convergent nozzle, but at the cost of an equally large air mass flow reduction at
Π = 2 and 160 krpm of shaft speed, so in order to implement this solution in
real-life applications it should be necessary to mechanically open the nozzle
throat at these high flow conditions.
To similarly quantify the influence of the geometries in noise emission at
the selected frequency band, in Fig. 8.11 an average sound intensity level
(SIL) is presented, as measured by the Brüel & Kjær intensity probe located
pointing directly to the inlet orifice.

Inlet geometry configuration

Figure 8.11: Comparison of mean sound intensity level for each of the inlet
geometries across the normal operating range of the engine.

Intensity level of the tapered duct is very similar to that of the reference
straight pipe; both when located as close as possible to the compressor wheel
and when separated 52 mm from it. The addition of the described IGV to
those tapered inlets notably reduces noise levels by 3 and 4 dB respectively.
Regarding the nozzle configurations, it can be seen that the convergentdivergent nozzle reduces noise output in the selected frequency band by 1 dB,
whereas the convergent nozzle features a notable reduction of approximately
3 dB compared to the reference.

8.3. Elbow parametric study
Having attested the influence of the inlet geometries not only in surge margin
and maximum flow but also regarding acoustic performance, it was decided
to use the turbocharger test rig used for the inlet local flow measurements
described in chapter 7 to study the effect of these geometric variations not
only in the global aspects of sound intensity and air mass flow but also
regarding local aspects like temperature distribution, skewness, etc.

The gathering of local flow experimental data will also be useful if CFD
simulations of these kind of inlet modifications are undertaken, in order to
provide a validation reference to check for the correct solving of not only
global values but also local flow field characteristics.
Since neither during the previously described on-engine experimental
campaign nor during the preliminary testing described at the beginning of
the present chapter was it possible to properly measure the sound intensity
caused by elbow geometries, it was decided that the study should start with
this kind of geometry variation.
Another reason to consider this geometry is that it introduces non-uniformities in the flow field that completely axisymmetric geometries such as
tapered ducts and nozzles do not, so it would provide a good contrast to
check the influence on circumferential temperature distribution skewness
and correlation with noise generation.
In order to increase the available data on the relation between inlet-induced
flow distortion, temperature skewness and noise output, it was decided that
a parametric campaign should be carried out where three 90º elbows of
different radius would be designed, manufactured and tested.

8.3.1. Geometry design
Requirements for the design of the elbow inlets were such that they could be
easily installed into the existing setup used for local measurements, coupling
to the adaptor piece and existent measurement pipe featuring the in-duct
intensity sensor array.
In addition, they needed to house the available linear thermocouple arrays
in order to measure the high temperature reversed flow (it should be noted
that the circumferential thermocouple array was installed into the adaptor
piece) approximately keeping the distance that was selected for the straight
pipe study.
Finally, to assess the influence of the flow distortion, the three selected
variants were as follows: a very tight elbow with a central radius of 0.75
compressor inlet diameters (marked as D in Fig. 8.12), a medium elbow
with 1D of radius and finally an elbow with a central radius of 1.5D that
would provide a smoother transition and less distorted flow.
To fulfil these design requirements, a decision was made to manufacture
the elbow prototypes using 3D printing instead of traditional workshop
means. This way, the guiding slots for the thermocouples and retention

screws could be directly embedded in the piece, along with the slots for the
sealing O-rings. Fig. 8.12 shows the mechanical drawing of the most abrupt
elbow with 0.75D of radius.
This design was implemented in a parametric CAD model to easily modify
the central radius. Also, a locking system was put into place so the elbow
could be affixed tightly to the compressor adaptor using a flange and a set
of threaded rods, similarly to the procedure performed for the local flow
characterization. The three prototypes generated in this way are shown in
Fig. 8.13.
Once that the three CAD models were generated, they were sent to a
commercial partner for verification and manufacturing. It should be noted
that the elbow prototypes were expected to withstand the high temperature
backflow coming from the compressor in unstable operating conditions
close to deep surge, without undertaking deformations that would have
misaligned the thermocouple array.

Taking into account these concerns, it was decided to manufacture the
elbow prototypes using an aluminium-filled polyamide through a process
known as Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), a technique in which a laser beam
is focused onto the surface of a tray containing the powdered material,
binding it together in layers to create the desired shape.
Specifications of the selected material can be found in table 8.1. Of special
relevance is the heat deflection temperature, also called sometimes heat
distortion temperature. It is defined as the temperature at which a sample,

under a defined load of 1.82 MPa, will start to deflect at least 0.25 mm.
Since in this case the inlet line is approximately at ambient pressure no
problem is expected until more elevated temperatures.

8.3.2. Setup
After SLS manufacturing and delivery, the prototype elbows were instrumented with thermocouples and installed into the anechoic chamber test
rig. Fig. 8.14 shows the assembly of the narrower elbow variant.
It should be noted that the narrow holes for the thermocouple alignment
became filled with residual dust during the sintering process, and had to
be finished with a manual drill. This presented no problem as the chosen
material is easily mechanized.

the circumferential temperature array, the inducer miniature pressure probe
and a sealing O-ring was kept in place, and the holes in the plane surface
added to the elbow were used to align the elbow parallel to the outlet and
tighten it using the threaded rods depicted in blue.

8.3.3. Results
During this experimental campaign, operating conditions were selected to
mirror those used in the local flow characterization chapter that featured a
straight inlet pipe, in order to allow the reconstruction of interpolated maps
that were as close as possible to the original reference map.

both the straight inlet pipe used as reference, and for the three described
elbow prototypes. It can be seen that repeatability was achieved in most
conditions up to a few g/s of air mass flow and ∼100 corrected rpm.
The most adverse conditions were those of maximum allowable flow,
specially at higher pressure ratios where the flow distortion and pressure loss
caused by the elbows made difficult to achieve exactly the same conditions.

8.3.3.1. Sound intensity
Using the in-duct piezoelectric sensor arrays, sound intensity level was
computed through the wave decomposition method outlined in chapter 3 for
each operating conditions. In order to focus into the previously described
“whoosh” noise problem, sound intensity level was averaged between 0.7 and
3 kHz. and then the interpolating procedure was used in order to reconstruct
noise maps for each geometry.
To highlight the differences between the reference straight duct noise map
and the result obtained for each elbow prototype, and taking into account the
aforementioned slight differences between operating conditions at higher
air mass flow settings, difference maps were produced by subtracting the
reference levels to each one of the newly obtained elbow maps.
It should be remarked that this subtraction procedure was not performed
between the raw levels at each measurement setting but between each
interpolated data point, and only where such interpolated data existed in
both noise maps (elbow and reference), as to avoid erroneous differences
due to the different operating conditions.
The results of this procedure can be seen in Fig. 8.16, where the difference
maps for the three elbow configurations regarding inlet and outlet in-duct
intensity are presented. Color scale has been kept constant in order to allow
a meaningful comparison between each map.
It can be seen in the maps, examining for instance some of the highest mass
flow rate points, that some information is missing around the black dot that
indicates the original measurement point before interpolation. This missing
data comes from slight differences in measurements between geometries,
as the subtraction process is only performed where data exists for both of
them.
As for the evolution of level difference with the variation of the elbow radius, the figure shows how in the case of the inlet sound intensity differences
appear to be higher than in the case of the outlet. This increase is specially
evident at lower flow conditions and medium-low shaft speeds, reaching up
to 6 dB in level increase.
There also appears to be a particular point with an small increase in level
for both inlet and outlet ducts, at medium air mass flow and medium to
hight shaft speeds, its relevance diminishing along with the reduction of the
elbow radius.

Figure 8.16: Difference map of inlet (left) and outlet (right) in-duct sound
intensity levels for each of the selected inlet elbows compared against the
reference straight duct. From top to bottom: 1.5D, 1D & 0.75D.

Finally, some operating conditions in both the inlet and outlet present
reduced noise output in the selected frequency band, specially at mediumhigher mass flows and lower shaft speeds. As with the case of the increases,
these reductions are more significant in the inlet duct, whereas positive and
negative variations are of smaller magnitude in the outlet duct.

In order to better quantify the SIL differences that these maps reveal,
histograms that represent the distribution of the differences have been
computed and presented in Fig. 8.17 for both inlet (top) and outlet (bottom)
sound intensity results.
It can be seen in the figure how the different elbow configurations affect
the distribution of the intensity level differences. In the case of the inlet,
the less narrow elbow (1.5D) and the medium elbow (1D) present a similar,
almost symmetric distribution with a mean around -1 dB.

level differences between each one of the tested elbow variants and the
reference straight inlet pipe. Y axis indicates the percentage of the interpolated
compressor map at which each difference level occurred. A dashed line

The distribution of the most narrow elbow (0.75D) appears to feature a
marked skewness towards positive differences of up to 6 dB that correspond
with the low flow, medium-low speed region identified in the aforementioned
intensity maps. These points shift the mean up to approximately 0.2 dB of
increased level.
Regarding the outlet difference distributions, the situation appears to
reverse, with the narrower elbow now featuring the most symmetric distribution and the other two variations presenting a marked skewness towards
intensity reduction values, again up to a mean of around 2 dB in the most
favourable case (1.5D elbow).

Figure 8.18: Comparison of plane wave range spectra from both inlet and
outlet, highlighting the differences between the straight reference duct and
each elbow configuration.

Focusing now into the detailed aspects of the sound level variation, it is
possible to compare the pressure spectra in different points to assess the
frequency distribution of the level variation. For instance in Fig. 8.18 the
PSD in the plane wave region recorded by inlet and outlet piezoelectric
sensors is shown for the different inlet geometries at an operating condition
with high differences.
In the case of the outlet duct, spectra are very similar up to a cut-off point
at approximately 1.3 kHz, below which the straight duct presents higher
levels than all of the elbows.
On the other hand, spectra on the plane wave region of the inlet duct
shows higher differences, consistent with the data already presented in the
maps and histograms.
It is interesting to note however that this increase is not homogeneous
in frequency; it can be seen how the small peak at 1.7 kHz present in the
straight duct gradually increases with elbow radius reduction, up to a clearly
visible broadband between 1.5 and 2.5 kHz.
These are flanked by another two smaller broadband elevations at 0.75
and 3.6 kHz that are also visible in the case of the outlet spectra, and were
also very clearly present in the pressure spectra recorded by the diffuser
pressure probe, shown for instance in Fig. 7.17 of the previous chapter.
It should be noted as well that, while levels for the detected broadband in
the inlet show an increase up to 5 dB, at these frequencies all of the outlet
spectra plotted in the lower graph remain at the same levels, indicating
that while changes in the inlet configuration seem to boost the upstream
transmission of the so-called “whoosh” broadband noise, no influence on
the outlet duct spectra is detected at these frequencies.

8.3.3.2. Temperature
Besides the described differences in terms of acoustic intensity produced by
the different inlet configurations, it is possible to follow a similar processing
procedure in order to assess the differences in terms of temperatures in the
inlet section that are related to the hot reversed flow coming from after the
compressor impeller.
As in the previous experimental campaign, data from the two thermocouple
arrays (longitudinal and circumferential) was processed in order to compile
maps of the backflow length and flow temperature skewness, respectively.

Figure 8.19: Difference maps of temperature circumferential standard deviation for each of the selected inlet elbows compared against the reference
straight duct.

These maps were then compared with the original reference map measured
with a straight inlet duct, and difference maps were produced for each elbow
variant. The resulting difference maps can be seen in Fig. 8.19. The same
color scale has been kept in all of them to provide a suitable comparison.
It can be seen that for the three cases a similar patters appears. An increase
in temperature skewness is consistently detected at the lower air mass flow
settings, specially at medium shaft speed operating conditions.
At higher air mass flow settings however, a slight reduction in flow temperature skewness is apparent, being much more pronounced in the less
narrow elbow configuration (1.5D, top left map).
This reduction area spans approximately the same conditions for the 1D
elbow, but the magnitude of the temperature skewness difference is lower
than in the previous case, becoming nearly zero in the case of the most
reduced elbow variant (0.75D).

Figure 8.20: Histograms of temperature standard deviation differences between each one of the tested elbow variants and the reference straight inlet
pipe. Y axis indicates the percentage of the interpolated compressor map at
which each difference level occurred. A dashed line indicates the average of
each configuration.

As in the case of sound intensity level differences, it is possible to combine these maps in the form of histograms in order to better quantify the
distribution of these differences. These histograms can be seen plotted in
Fig. 8.20.
Distributions shown in this figure appear similar in shape, but shifted in
mean value. In all three cases the right tail of the distribution is longer but
less populated, indicating that the difference increase happens abruptly in a
small region of the compressor map.
On the contrary, the left tails are more populated but shorter, meaning
that more regions of the compressor map feature points with slightly lower
differences than the average. These averages reach up to 1ºC in the case of
the most narrow elbow configuration (0.75D), while the average is almost
zero for the case of the less narrow elbow (1.5D).
As mentioned earlier, by processing the temperature profiles measured by
the longitudinal thermocouple array that was added to the design of each
elbow prototype, it is also possible to estimate the length of the hot reversed
backflow that travels upstream of the impeller and into the inlet in unstable
operating conditions.

When designing the prototypes, care was put to ensure that the separation
between the thermocouples remained equal to that of the straight inlet duct,
taking into account their inserted length of half a radius and the varying
radius of each elbow pipe.
In Fig. 8.21 the estimated length along the exterior edge of the elbow
(where the thermocouple array was installed, as shown in Fig. 8.12) is
mapped for the three elbow configurations.

Figure 8.21: Difference maps of high temperature backflow extent for each of
the selected inlet elbows compared against the reference straight duct.

In this case, differences range from minus half a diameter up to plus a
diameter when compared with the reference straight pipe. The patterns of
these differences along the compressor map appears to be similar for the
three geometric variations: a slight reduction at lower mass flow conditions
and a slight increase at higher mass flow conditions for all shaft speeds.
Exceptions to this pattern are some of the lowest air mass flow data points
at 100 and 120 krpm for the two narrower elbows (0.75D and 1D), where the
backflow length appears to feature a large increase. However it is possible
that those are spurious results from the interpolation procedure, since the
increase region is very small.

between each one of the tested elbow variants and the reference straight inlet

each configuration.

These low count extreme points are best shown when the data is put into
histogram form as seen in Fig. 8.22. In this figure it can be seen how the
three backflow length difference distributions are quite similar in shape and
values.
The three distributions feature approximately the same mean, around 0.1
diameters of backflow length reduction from the straight inlet case. However,
the most usual difference (that is, the mode) the difference is practically zero.
It must be also considered that estimation of backflow is only performed
along the outer edge of the elbow, while the modified flow pattern could
mean that a very non-symmetric backflow is propagating upstream.

8.3.3.3. Correlations between SIL and temperature
In Fig. 8.23 the correlation between sound intensity level and circumferential
temperature skewness has been performed again for the three elbow inlet
cases as it was made in chapter 7 for the case of the straight pipe, which
has been included as a reference keeping the same axis limits of the elbow
cases.
It can be seen in this figure how for the straight pipe and the more straight
elbow (that with an central radius equal to 1.5D), both pictured on the top
plots, a clear separation is maintained between higher flow rate conditions

the straight pipe and the three elbow inlets. Size indicates shaft speed from
low to high and color indicates mass flow from higher (blues) to lower (reds).

(indicated as blue circles) which exhibit higher noise levels even when no
skewness is detected, and those of lower flow rate where skewness is well
correlated with the increase in noise levels.
In the case of the more narrow elbows, pictured in the bottom plots of the
figure, the difference between the higher and lower flow rate cases becomes
blurred, as even points of the higher flow rate demonstrate measurable
temperature skewness as the elbow radius decreases.
By comparing the four plots of the figure, it can also be seen how the
maximum values of temperature skewness increase as the radius of the pipe
decreases, with the same trend being followed by the sound intensity level
in the selected frequency band, as was clearly seen previously in Fig. 8.17

where the characteristic “hump” of whoosh noise becomes more pronounced
as the radius of the elbow gets narrower (while a similar influence is not
observed in the outlet spectra).

8.4. Conclusions
Through this chapter, three different experimental campaigns aimed at
assessing the influence of the inlet geometry in the turbocharger acoustic
output have been presented. While different in scope and means, the results
shown in this chapter allow some global conclusions to be drawn.
First, a series of tests was carried out where simple geometric variants were
added to the compressor inlet, with a straight duct of the same diameter
than the compressor inducer being as a reference. This reference was
maintained for the three described experimental campaigns. Both orifice
noise recorded with a free-field microphone and orifice noise averaged
between four microphones were recorded.
Results of this first test series showed that, apart from an effect in the
turbocharger surge margin that had been previously pointed out by Galindo
et al. [62], influence of the geometries on both orifice and radiated noise
could be found. The tapered duct appeared to increase the orifice noise,
while the reservoir acted as a resonator and not only increased surge margin
but lowered both orifice (2 dB) and radiated noise (3 dB). Meanwhile, the
elbow increased kept the same orifice noise levels.
Another series of geometry tests were carried out in an engine cell and
introduced more complex geometry combinations, with tapered ducts featuring an IGV device and the addition of two nozzles to the inlet line, besides
the reference straight pipe. In this case noise output was measured by a
commercial intensity probe aligned with the inlet orifice and with the in-duct
intensimetry method based on beamforming wave decomposition described
in chapter 3.
Acoustic data from this on-engine campaign confirmed that the selected
tapered duct, while revealing an improvement in surge margin and maximum
flow when located at a certain distance from the impeller, did not evidence
a significant effect in orifice noise intensity and in any case these differences
were harmful with a slight increase in levels, albeit of less than 0.5 dB.

The addition of an IGV device to boost incoming flow swirl proved interesting as it decreased the acoustic intensity recorded by the orifice probe by
3-4 dB depending on the position of the tapered duct. However this device
negatively impacted the maximum flow and, depending on the position of
the downstream tapered section, also the surge margin.
In the case of the inlet geometries equipped with a nozzle, a decrease of
orifice noise was found ranging from 1 dB (converge-divergent nozzle) to 3
dB (convergent nozzle). These nozzles also improved surge margin up to
20%, but, specially the convergent one, decreased the maximum available
air mass flow.
Finally, a more through experimental campaign was carried out where a
family of 90º elbow inlets with different radii (that were not tested on the
engine due to packaging constraints) were installed on the anechoic test ring
and instrumented to measure not only in-duct noise but also temperature
distribution through the thermocouple arrays described in chapter 7.
Results from this campaign provided higher in-depth insight into the
influence of the elbow radius; as in the aforementioned first testing campaign
the very sharp elbow showed equal or slightly higher mean sound intensity
in the inlet. However, this increase was not uniformly distributed across the
compressor map but concentrated on the lowest allowable air mass setting
for each shaft speed. This pattern was shared among the three tested elbow
configurations, although as the radius grew sound intensity levels in both
inlet and outlet reduced up to 1 dB in average.
Regarding the influence of the inlet elbow variants on the temperature
distribution, a similar pattern of circumferential skewness increase towards
the lowest allowable flow conditions for each shaft speed could be reconstructed. However, reversed flow length appears similar in all cases, with
differences of less than 0.5 inlet diameters.
Correlations of whoosh noise content and temperature skewness indicated
an increase of both variables as the elbow radius became narrower. Reasons
for these correlated increases could be related to the uneven presentation of
the air flow caused by the progressively narrow 90º elbows1 , which could
create a region of lower pressure that facilitated the upstream propagation
of reversed flow and thus enhanced the convection of whoosh noise content
from the diffuser to the inlet duct, while also increasing the differences in
temperature across the different zones.

See the work of Kalpakli et al. [123, 124] for an in-depth numerical analysis of the
particular flow field caused by these kind of 90º elbows, including its POD decomposition.
1

This would explain why elbow radius shows a clear effect on the whoosh
noise content in the inlet spectra shown in Fig. 8.18 but not in the outlet,
and also why this effect is restricted to the lower mass flow rate zones of
the compressor map (see Fig. 8.16 for the effect on sound intensity and
Fig. 8.19 for the effect on temperature skewness) where reversed flow is
more prominent, as instabilities grow while inflow momentum diminishes.
In any case, further research, specially if performed together with CFD
simulations, is needed to characterize the effect of the inlet flow field at
unstable conditions and its relation to coherent flow structures acting as
noise sources.

CHAPTER 9

Conclusions and future works
In this chapter the concluding remarks of this doctoral thesis are presented,
gathering together the main findings that have been obtained during the
research described in the previous chapters and the global contributions
that have been made to the state of the art in the field of the acoustic
characterization of turbocharger compressors, specially focusing on the
different methodological procedures and the results that their application
has offered.
To conclude, some future works of interest are suggested, that could be
pursued in order to expand the knowledge obtained during this investigation
applying both the experimental techniques that have been described in the
previous chapters and the numerical tools that have been validated as part
of this thesis.

9.1. Conclusions
The main conclusions of the work performed during the development this
doctoral thesis can be globally categorized by the point of view of methodology procedures that have been presented, validated and discussed and, on
the other hand, by the results about the acoustic output of the compressor
that the application of these procedures has provided.
These conclusions fulfil the objectives that were outlined for this work,
increasing the available knowledge on the acoustic behaviour of turbocharger
compressors and the methodologies that are useful in its characterization.
It is hoped that this knowledge aids in the development of better turbocharger designs and implementations, thereby contributing to the mitigation of the concerns raised by noise emission caused by automotive
applications with quieter and more efficient engines.

203

9.1.1. Methodology
Along the different chapters of this doctoral thesis several techniques have
been described that are useful to characterize the noise emission of turbocharger compressors, mainly experimentally but also by analyzing the
results of numerical simulations. The main findings, contributions and
conclusions about these methodologies can be summarized as follows:
Beamforming wave decomposition has been proved to be a useful technique to obtain experimental measurements of in-duct sound intensity
in turbocharger compressor inlet and outlet pipes. A methodology has
been presented in order to use this information to build noise maps
and spectrograms that characterize the acoustic performance of the
compressor along the region of interest of its operating conditions
map.
Comparisons made with inlet orifice noise measurements performed on
an anechoic chamber show that in-duct sound intensity results are well
correlated with orifice noise information, which is a metric of interest
in automotive applications. External acoustic radiation measurements
were also performed, coupled with sequential insulation in order to
assess the contribution of each part of the turbocharger system.
Further validation of this methodology in an engine test cell equipped
for turbocharger characterization including an orifice intensity probe
has shown that the technique is robust even in the case where pulsations from the reciprocating internal combustion engine are present in
the spectral content of the compressor duct pressure, leading to more
coherent results that other wave decomposition techniques. External
near field measurements performed with an Acoustic Particle Velocity
probe demonstrated promising potential to isolate the specific acoustic
contribution of the turbocharger.
Usefulness of beamforming wave decomposition has also been shown
regarding the validation of results coming from CFD simulations of
the compressor. In conjunction with numerical MoC decomposition,
validation of simulated pressure spectra against experimental data
has been shown. Other post-processing techniques such as Fourier
analysis and Dynamic Mode Decomposition have also been demonstrated to offer valuable information regarding the identification of

acoustical sources, specially concerning complex flow phenomena
in the compressor inlet, inducer and diffuser at unstable operating
conditions.
In order to investigate these complex flow features a methodology
for experimental measurements of local temperature, pressure and
velocity has been developed and presented, showing how these unstable phenomena evolve as air mass flow rate is reduced. Specifically,
processing of the temperature readings were used to characterize
the growth of the reversed flow in order to perform Particle Image
Velocimetry in selected operating conditions.
Different approaches to successfully apply the PIV procedure to longitudinal and transversal planes of the glass pipe confining the reversed
flow were found and described. Results from these velocity field characterization were found to be in good agreement with data measured
by thermocouple arrays, with the growth of this backflow also correlated with increased sound intensity propagation in the whoosh
frequency band.
A methodology for accurate assessment of the influence that different inlet geometries have on the compressor performance regarding
not only surge margin but also regarding acoustic output has been
presented, including the implementation of an experimental installation that allows the fast acoustic testing of custom 3D-printed inlet
geometries up to 1/3 diameters from the compressor wheel.

9.1.2. Results
During the development and application of the aforementioned methodological procedures, valuable results regarding the acoustic behaviour of
turbocharger compressors were found, being the most relevant among them
as follows:
Analysis of the in-duct decomposed pressure spectra correctly identified acoustic features that were described in the literature review
performed as starting point of the doctoral thesis tonal noise caused by
the blade passing, broadband whoosh noise at plane wave frequencies,
and a TCN-like broadband at higher frequencies. Non-dimensional
analysis of these phenomena suggested the first being related to flow
effects and the later ascribed to transmission effects. Furthermore, the

TCN-like broadband appeared to be unable to propagate at plane wave
frequencies, unlike the whoosh noise band which appears at these
conditions. This demonstrates a clear difference between these two
broadband phenomena and provides a simple criterion to tell them
apart.
Sound intensity level maps measured in the anechoic chamber flow
rig were compiled for different frequency bands, reproducing for
instance the relation between very low frequency content and deep
surge onset. In contrast, whoosh noise level iso-contours were not
parallel to deep surge onset but more related to the inception of mild
surge at the maximum pressure ratio condition for each constant speed
characteristic line.
Inspection of selected spectra and specially the spectrograms reconstructed from the interpolated map results clearly demonstrated however the presence of typical whoosh noise content even at conditions
close to the maximum efficiency region of the compressor map and
well before the inception of mild surge, pointing to the source flow
mechanism of whoosh noise not being rotating stall or large reversed
flow vortices that only appear after mild surge onset.
Once that validation of CFD simulations attested that numerical data
correctly followed experimental results, specially regarding the presence of the whoosh noise band in simulated pressure spectra, postprocessing of CFD results at different operating conditions (that were
simulated using experimentally-measured boundary conditions) indicated that reversed flow did not appear until the maximum pressure
ratio point, although vortex shedding in the diffuser was present for
all conditions. Fourier analysis also showed that for a typical whoosh
band frequency, amplitude higher at the diffuser than at the ducts.
DMD analysis of the outlet wall cells identified modes related to BPF
and whoosh noise frequencies as the most relevant in terms of coherence.
Experimental results from the local variable characterization provided
experimental data on the backflow growth across the compressor map
through the analysis of temperature evolution, confirming that stable,
high flow rate conditions where no backflow was detected through temperature nor through velocity measurements still presented whoosh
noise content, measured not only through the beamforming arrays but

also through the inducer and diffuser probes, where the characteristic
hump was detected even for the higher flow rate condition, thereby
pointing to an origin for this noise phenomenon not related to reversed
or stalled inlet flow.
Analysis of the influence of inlet geometry demonstrated that the
acoustic performance of the compressor can be modified with the
addition of different elements such as 90º elbows, tapered ducts,
reservoirs, nozzles, etc. Effect of the elbow radius was specifically
investigated, showing how sound intensity level and circumferential
temperature skewness differences were particularly significant at the
lower mass flow rates where inlet flow carries less momentum, something which was hinted by the preliminary results as nozzles and IGVs
which highly affect the flow presentation have the larger effect on
noise in the whoosh band. Coupled with the correlation analysis and
the conclusions from previous chapters, this seems to reinforce the
hypothesis of whoosh noise being generated by flow interaction in the
diffuser, its level in the inlet at unstable conditions being raised by
convection effects as the reversed backflow carries its spectral content
upstream.

9.2. Future works
In order to confirm these hypotheses and gain further information on the
influence of geometry and flow presentation on the different acoustic phenomena that are of concern regarding turbocharger compressors, some
future works are suggested in this section, from the point of view of both
experimental research and numerical simulations.

9.2.1. Experimental research
By taking advantage of the experimental techniques and the facilities developed in the framework of this doctoral thesis, a follow up investigation
could be envisaged where the following points could be of interest:
An exploratory analysis of different simple geometries could be performed, taking special interest in how the inlet flow is affected at
unstable conditions in the mild surge region and how the modification
of this flow pattern, as described with the aid of the presented local
measurement techniques, influences the transmission of whoosh noise
and other concerning acoustic emissions.

Acoustic Particle Velocity measurements could be used to characterise
the detailed spatial distribution of the near-field noise radiated by the
turbocharger assembly, thus assisting in locating the most relevant
sources for each acoustic phenomena identified in the already obtained
spectral content.
The turbocharger facilities could be modified with the addition of
compression drivers1 in order to provide external excitations which
could be used to measure acoustical properties of the compressor
assembly such as the full scattering matrix, with the aim of building
realistic acoustic models of the compressor at different operating
settings.

9.2.2. Numerical simulations
These experimental works could also provide valuable information to initialize and validate further numerical simulations that could provide a deeper
insight in how the flow field interacts inside the compressor and how it
evolves with the different working conditions, such as:
Modification of the initial CFD model with more realistic inlet and
outlet ducts, improved boundary conditions and heat transfer models
that could be useful to enhance the identification of spectral content
generated by the turbocharger compressor and better compare against
experimental temperature data.
Use of this improved model to analyze the effect of different inlet
geometries and how the flow pattern is affected by these additions.
This study would be specially relevant if carried out conjunction with
experimental measurements performed using the setup presented in
this work.
Implementation of advanced post-processing routines such as the Dynamic Mode Decomposition technique outlined in chapter 6, mainly if
coupling with existing solvers could be achieved by use of streaming
DMD algorithms that avoid the need for large data storage and processing. These techniques would allow easier matching between relevant
flow structures and their corresponding frequency contribution.

Essentially, special loudspeakers featuring a strong titanium diaphragm capable of
withstanding the high pressure levels of the compressor ducts.

Extension of the numerical setup beyond uncoupled internal flow, encompassing vibro-acoustic and noise radiation simulations by means
of one-way or fully coupled fluid/solid interaction modelling. This
extended setup could be validated through near- and far-field experimental measurements as described in this work, thereby developing a
comprehensive model of the turbocharger compressor acoustics that
would be useful for faster simulation-based design cycles.
