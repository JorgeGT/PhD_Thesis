Abstract
The performance of different experimental techniques proposed in the literature for acoustic characterization was assessed through the study of the noise
generated by the compressor of an automotive turbocharger under different
working conditions in an engine test cell. The most critical restrictions of
in-duct intensimetry methods regarding frequency limitations are presented
and experimentally demonstrated. The results provided by those methods
were correlated against a reference intensity probe. A beamforming method
based on three-sensor phased arrays appears to be the most reliable approach
in the plane wave range, presenting higher accuracy than the more common
two-microphone method and simple pressure level measurements. Also,
preliminary results from a novel radiated noise quantification technique
based on acoustic particle velocity are presented and discussed. The results
indicate that further research on this topic is required.

CHAPTER 1

Introduction
“The story is set in the year 1922 and has its main
character, Mr Engelbert, moving to Prague from the
countryside to live out his retirement years and struggling
to cope with the aggressive modernity of the city. The
horror is not the power of money or the arrogance of
the people, but the noise; not the age-old noise of a
thunderstorm or a hammer, but the new noise of engines,
especially of automobiles and motor-cycles, the explosive
internal combustion monsters.”

Milan Kundera, The Curtain.

As Milan Kundera shows, the noise produced by internal combustion vehicles
has radically changed the way we understand cities; even many decades
before we understood the dangers that chemical emissions pose to the environment and our health, noise emissions were without a doubt a commotion
for city inhabitants worldwide: an horrific, roaring hallmark of accelerated
progress.
Nowadays, no one is surprised anymore by the sound of an automobile or
a “motor-cycle”. Even the mere absence of this familiar, background urban
sound is unsettling to many. Road traffic is, however, the main source of
noise pollution in cities. As an example, Fig 1.1 depicts global noise levels
in the city of Valencia.
It can be clearly seen how automotive vehicles define the noise environment
in our cities; high-traffic roads appear as higher level sources of noise that
propagates towards less travelled areas. The (traffic-restricted) campus of
Universitat Politècnica de València, where this thesis has been developed,
appears as a blue, quieter island at the upper right part of the figure.

Noise emission by automotive vehicles is, however, a sum of very complex
phenomena. One could consider, intuitively, that the dominant factor of this
sum must be the the combustion noise itself: several explosions going off
every second of operation, their vibration propagating through the metallic
engine block and radiating through the air.
However, many of other sources of noise exist in a vehicle: aerodynamic
noise produced as air flows around the structures and through the intake
and exhaust pipes, friction noise of the tires against the asphalt of the road,
mechanical noise of the engine parts working together, auxiliary systems
such as fuel injection, pumps and, increasingly important, the noise produced
by the turbocharger group.

1.1. Turbochargers
The idea of using a compressor to increase the density of air available in the
combustion chamber of an engine is now more than a century old. While
Gottlieb Daimler’s 1885 patent included a supercharging mechanical pump,
and Louis Renault’s 1902 patent featured a centrifugal supercharger, the
first design for a turbocharger (this is, a supercharging compressor driven by
the exhaust gasses) was presented in Alfred Büchi’s 1905 patent Nº204630
from the Imperial Patent Office of the German Reich.

Normalized relevance [%]

While some racing and luxury sport cars had supercharged engines (the
popular Mercedes Kompressor series started in 1921), most mass produced
cars used simpler, naturally aspirating engines.
During the first half of the XX century, the primary area of application of
turbocharging where marine and, specially, aviation engines. The addition
of turbocharging to aircraft engines allowed them to counter the diminishing
air density at high altitude, increasing the available power and operating
ceiling. For instance, the first product made by Cliff Garrett’s corporation
was a supercharged air cooler for the B-17 Flying Fortress.
It was not until the sixties that turbocharging made its appearance into the
popular automotive market, with the Chevrolet Corvair Monza and the aptly
named Oldsmobile Jetfire. However, technology was still not very reliable,
and they were quickly retired from the dealerships.
The scene changed radically during the seventies. Several factors (the oil
crisis, enhanced reliability, stringent emission requirements, turbocharged
cars winning Formula 1 and Le Mans races) made possible the first successful
passenger diesel cars, that grew during the 80s and 90s to dominate the
diesel automotive market.
To illustrate this evolution, Fig. 1.2 shows how words like “turbocharger”
and “traffic noise” started to appear in English literature. We can see a
sudden bump of “turbocharger” mentions following the start of WWII (where
turbocharging aircraft quickly became norm), but the peak of popularity
appears in the 80s. Concern for “traffic noise” on the other hand suddenly
boosts from 1965 to 1975.

Chapter 1. Introduction

This figure also shows how from the last years of the XX century, social
concern for the nocive effects of pollutant emissions has grown. These
include NOx , CO, CO2 , particulate matter (PM) and so on. In a bid to lower
emissions, a trend of downsizing engines has become popular, aiming to
increase efficiency and lower contaminants by reducing the displacement
and cylinder count, in both petrol and diesel markets. Upcoming regulations
are even more stringent [1], so this tendency is only expected to grow.
As power and torque must be maintained in these reduced displacement
engines, turbocharging requirements increase, becoming more and more
popular in the petrol market as well. Further information on the relationship
between stringent emissions policies, downsizing and turbocharging can be
found in the work of Schumann et al [2].

1.2. Noise emissions
Another important aspect of increasing concern for both regulators and
consumers is the so-called NVH (Noise, Vibration and Harshness) problems
that opened this chapter.
While downsizing increases efficiency and allows engines to better meet
emission requirements, this strategy has some downsides. For instance,
it has been shown [3] that at certain operating conditions, a downsized
engine will radiate higher noise levels than an equivalent engine of larger
displacement.
Increased turbocharging requirements also imply that the compressor
must work near its limiting conditions, such as the surge limit [4], where
compressor airflow is so low that it reverses, allowing hot air to escape the
compressor upstream instead of downstream. This potentially destructive
condition is initiated with flow instabilities that are also linked to increased
noise output, as will be further explored along this work.
Another factor that must be taken into account during the analysis of
acoustical emissions is that raw noise quantity (overall level) is not the only
concern, for noise quality (for example, its particular frequency distribution)
is also an important problem, regarding both the possibilities of sound
mitigation and psychoacoustic response by the customer, as shown in [5]
and the work of Nor et al [6].

1.3. State of the art

1.3. State of the art
These concerns have led to a thriving research effort regarding turbocharging
efficiency, usefulness to reduce pollution and contribution to noise emissions.
Several approaches to this problem are being tested. Some researchers
conduct experimental analysis of the internal fluid flow of the compressor.
Others focus their interest in the externally radiated acoustic field. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations are carried out in order to visualize
the different flow phenomena inside and near the compressor.
Aside from experimental or numerical characterization of the acoustic
problem, its mitigation is also being actively investigated. Options range from
the modification of inlet or casing geometries, to the addition of different
silencers and resonators on the compressor pipes.
Through this research, different acoustical phenomena have been identified. While some like the tonal noise produced by the blade pass (known
as Blade Pass Frequency or BPF) have a clear, straightforward explanation,
others are not yet fully understood.
For example, a certain wideband noise known as “whoosh” in the literature
has been lately of interest, with explanations for its generation ranging from
turbulent vorticity to fluid interaction with tip clearance (the gap between
the wheel blades and the casing wall). Further research is currently ongoing
on this particular phenomenon.

1.4. Objectives
The objective of this thesis is threefold, covering not only the experimental
acoustic analysis itself but also its methodological and application aspects.
To sum up, the different but related objectives can be enumerated as:
Enlarging the corpus of published experimental results of turbocharger
compressor acoustic measurements across its different operating conditions: as the literature is still reduced, expanding it will improve not
only understanding of known phenomena but will also identify other
areas that may be of interest for further research.
Presenting a comprehensive experimental methodology, from instrumentation to measuring procedures and signal processing, in order
to consistently and reliably characterize acoustic emissions, ensuring
at the same time the robustness of these techniques when faced with
real engine conditions.

Chapter 1. Introduction

Exploring how this experimental methodology can be applied not only
to the characterization of the internal sound field, but also to the
initialization and validation of numerical simulations and the study of
the influence of different inlet geometries on noise generated by the
compressor.

1.5. Thesis outline
After this introduction that constitutes chapter 1, a comprehensive literature
review on turbocharger compressor noise research will be carried out in
chapter 2. This review will introduce relevant developments regarding experimental compressor testing, but also some literature concerning numerical
simulations that are of vital importance to improve the understanding of the
fluid field causing the acoustical emission.
Chapter 3 will present the different methodologies used in the experimental campaign performed during this thesis, along with the facilities and
equipment used to this effect. These methodologies include procedures for
the characterization of the internal sound field, but external radiation is also
considered to test for relevant correlations, along with the measurement of
relevant thermodynamic variables near the compressor inlet. Theoretical
background, limitations and best practices regarding the use of the presented
methodologies will be also discussed.
The results of the experimental campaign carried out using the described
methodology will constitute chapter 4. As with the preceding chapter, internal and external noise field will be presented separately. However, the last
section of the chapter will introduce correlations between the two results.
Detailed measurement of thermodynamic variables next to the compressor
wheel will enable further comprehension of the particularities of the fluid
field and its relation with the acoustical sources.
Procedures described on chapter 3 will then be implemented on an engine
test cell in order to assess their performance in real engine conditions.
This performance will be compared to established methods such as the
two-microphone method and the pressure-pressure intensity probe. While
external measurements are difficult in a non-anechoic environment such as
the engine test cell, an example of the acoustical particle velocity method
will be tested to address this limitation.

Chapter 6 will explore how the obtained experimental results can be used
to initialize and validate numerical simulations. In turn, these simulations
can provide insight into particularities of the flow field and suggest further
experimental measurements that can be relevant for the understanding of
the phenomena involved in the generation of noise.
Particularly, influence of the inlet geometry immediately upstream of
the compressor wheel has been proved of significant relevance in both
compressor performance and noise emission. Chapter 7 will present an
experimental parametric study of different geometries and their influence
on the the compressor behaviour.
Finally, chapter 8 will offer the conclusions that have been reached through
the experimental campaign and analysis of results, along with suggestions
of future works that could be carried out to advance knowledge of this topic.

CHAPTER 2

Literature review
In order to provide a better context for the development of this work, a
literature review has been carried out. Special emphasis has been put
into existing experimental research of automotive turbocharger acoustics,
although techniques and results from related fields are also presented when
applicable.
For instance, numerical simulations on the topic are becoming more numerous. They offer further insight into the underlying flow structures even
if clear, causal correlations have not yet been demonstrated. As such, these
studies merit their own specific section.
Another point related to these flow structures that deserves interest is
the analysis of how the particularities of the inlet geometry immediately
upstream of the compressor wheel influence the performance and the noise
emission of the system. Not only this influence offers clues of which mechanisms are responsible for certain acoustic phenomena, but they also present
an interesting possibility of mitigation.

2.1. Experimental research
While the acoustical emission of axial compressors has been a subject of
extensive research since more than fifty years ago [7, 8], studies performed
on centrifugal turbocharger are more comparatively more scarce.
Of the existing literature dealing with centrifugal turbomachinery, many
efforts were directed at large fans or centrifugal pumps, with small turbochargers have begun only recently to be more relevant.

16

Chapter 2. Literature review

Among the first it is worth to mention the extensive research carried out
at Pennsylvania State University, where at least since the nineties [9] an
instrumented centrifugal pump was installed in an anechoic flow bench to
characterize its acoustical performance.
This setup allowed several researchers to conduct experiments analysing
not only in-duct noise, as in the works of Mongeau et al [9, 10] and radiated
noise, as shown by Choi et al [11, 12], but also pressure distribution on the
blade surface [9, 11].
A related experimental campaign, starting at least from the turn of the
millennium, was carried out at the University of Siegen. Here, Wolfram and
Carolus [13] used again a centrifugal pump inside an anechoic chamber.
In this case, measurements were done relying in anemometers directed
at the blades that could be rotated at will in order to analyse azimuthal
rotating modes [14]. Radiated noise could be also measured using a single
microphone [15].
Both Penn State and Siegen campaigns show significant aspects of interest
such as the identification of Blade Pass Frequency (BPF) peaks on the acoustic spectrum and hints on the link between stall and noise [9]. Relevant
dimensionless numbers such as the Strouhal and Helmoltz numbers are also
suggested [10].
However, it is important to notice that there are important differences
between these large centrifugal pumps and small turbocharger compressor
for automotive purposes.
These differences are found not only in the geometrical design aspect but
also in the order of rotational speed. While the considered pumps do not
exceed 3600 rpm, small automotive turbochargers can exceed 200 krpm.
Also, they are affected by the pulsating flow of the alternating engine,
which will be present in the acoustic signature as well. This later aspect will
be shown in chapter 5.
In order to address these differences and focus the literature review in
the specific issues presented by turbocharger compressors, selected works
from the literature will be reviewed in the following subsections, placing
special interest in both the measurement techniques and the acoustical
results obtained.

2.1.1. Methods for turbocharger noise characterization
Although not numerous, acoustical research works on small, centrifugal
turbocharger compressors can be found in the literature. Many of them are
published by automotive or compressor manufacturers, who are among the
most concerned about compressor noise emissions.
Starting from the work of Trochon [16] and Evans and Ward [17, 18] up
to more recent investigations such as those of Åbom, Kabral and Rammal
[19, 20] at the Swedish Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), several different
methodologies for characterising the acoustical emission of automotive
turbochargers can be found.
A first division can be made between those studies aiming to measure
internal flow noise, placing sensors inside the compressor housing or inlet
and outlet ducts, and those works based on external measurements of the
radiated noise.
Evans and Ward [17, 18] opted for a simple setup of four microphones
to measure sound radiation. These four microphones were situated on the
same plane and directed to a turbocharger-equipped engine. They were
distributed at 90º with a separation of one meter from the engine. From the
pressure readings of these four microphones, Sound Pressure Level (SPL)
was computed and then averaged among them, in order to get a single signal
from which spectrograms and sound spectra could be derived.
A similar setup was used by Teng and Homco [4] (see specially Fig. 1) in
order to test different countermeasures for whoosh noise mitigation, such
as engine calibration, resonators in the compressor inlet/outlet, compressor
trim variation and a swirl generation device.
This kind of averaging four spatially-distributed microphones method was
implemented in the anechoic chamber in order to characterize the far-field
radiated sound of the turbocharger group during the experimental campaign;
further information will provided on subsection 3.4.2 of chapter 3.
Apart from the far-field radiation, another acoustic problem of interest
is that of orifice noise, this is, the noise created by the ingestion of the air
stream into the opening of the turbocharger inlet duct.
Lee et al [21] used a Brüel & Kjær free field type microphone pointed at
the compressor inlet as seen of Fig. 8 of the reference. It can also be noted
that in order to avoid “flow effects”, the microphone was located 0.8 away
from the inlet.

18

|

Chapter 2. Literature review

The setup selected by Guillou et al [22] to measure ingestion noise was
very similar. Here, a single microphone was positioned aligned with the
axis of the turbocharger at a distance of 0.4 m, again facing directly to the
compressor inlet bell mouth.
Another solution was implemented by Figurella et al in [23]. In this case,
a Brüel & Kjær type 2235 Sound Level Meter was positioned 0.25 m from the
inlet duct orifice, at a 45º angle from the inlet axis. In [24] Figurella et al
opted instead to rely on a ¼” microphone affixed at the same position, 0.25
m away from the mouth and 45º from the axis. Both instruments appear in
Fig. 1 of [24].
During the experimental campaign that was carried out for the development of this thesis, two free field microphones were situated at a distance
of 10 and 20 cm from the inlet pipe orifice. This will be expanded in detail
in subsection 3.4.1 of chapter 3.
Finally, a third approach for the characterization of compressor noise is
based on measuring the sound field inside the inlet and outlet ducts, usually
by means of fast pressure sensors. This has the advantage of not needing to
ensure anechoic conditions in the test cell. Another remarkable advantage
is that, by analysing the flow field alone, one can avoid the influence of the
radiative properties of the duct material and geometry.
As these advantages make this last approach specially interesting for a
research centred on the sources of aero-acoustical generated noise, emphasis
has been put in reviewing existing literature dealing with internal flow noise.
Early work by Trochon [16] dealt with the acoustic characterization of
turbocharger noise measuring in-duct airborne noise at the compressor exit
(see Fig. 1 of the reference) during engine operation.
Gaudé et al [25] from Honeywell Turbo Technologies presented an extensive review of different vibro-acoustic sources of turbocharger noise. Both
accelerometers and pressure sensors affixed to the pipes were used, and
their use to identify some vibro-acoustic phenomena was demonstrated.
While this work omits a proper, referenced methodology description, it mentions that acoustic noise intensity is calculated using wave decomposition by
means of three sensors, indicating the range of plane wave for the installed
ducts.
Raitor and Neise [26] used different methods, taking into account the
presence of acoustic modes in the duct. the first one consisted on a ½"
microphone equipped with a turbulence screen and mounted in a rotatable section of the duct. This allows the measurement of circumferentially

2.1. Experimental research

19

averaged sound pressure level (SPL), in accordance with ISO 5136. This
rotatable section can also be fitted with four consecutive rings, each with
four flush-mounted condenser microphones for analysis of acoustic modes.
This last technique is similar to that used in the previously mentioned
work by Guillou et al [22], where four Kulite model XCS-190-5D miniature
pressure sensors were mounted on the compressor inlet adaptor, equally
separated 90º. A single Kulite model XTEL-160-50G was used on the outlet
duct.
A single in-duct fast pressure sensor was also the technique selected by
Figurella et al [23, 24]. In this case Kistler piezoresistive transducers were
used, both in the compressor inlet duct (model 4045A2) and in the outlet
duct (model 4045A2 or 4045A5).
Pai et al [27, 28] opted as well for a single sensor (in this case labelled as
a microphone) to measure sound pressure level inside the compressor inlet
duct. An ambient microphone was present as well, but its readings are not
included in their work.
A different approach was taken by Tiijoka et al [29], who describe the use
of an array of three pressure transducers in both inlet and outlet pipes of
their compressor setup (see Figs. 1-3 of the reference). In order to estimate
the strength of the propagating nodes, a cross-spectra averaging technique
was used.

Chapter 2. Literature review

In table 2.1 a synthesis of the information compiled in this subsection is
presented. It can be seen how only one reference [25] used sound intensity,
which is inherently a more robust magnitude. Sound pressure level, on
the other hand, is easily influenced by the particular geometric setup and
measurement location. It is also apparent that, while measurements have
been presented regarding inlet, outlet, mouth and external noise, no study
as far (as the author knows) has been presented regarding all four options
simultaneously.

2.1.2. Relevant results
After reviewing the different methods available on the literature regarding
turbocharger noise, a selection of relevant acoustical results from these
works is offered in this subsection. It is worth noting that while some of the
referred research was directly aimed at characterizing noise output, other
works had different objectives and only used noise measurement as a metric,
without discussing its characteristics or generation process.
An interesting introduction is provided by Gaudé et al, whose work collects
a variety of different noise-generating phenomena in turbochargers [25].
Table 2.2 reproduces this classification. Several tone sources are proposed,
mainly linked to the imbalance of the rotor and irregularities and lack of
symmetry of the compressor wheel. Another source of tones is the passing
of the blades of both turbine and compressor, in special the main ones in
the case of the later.
Besides the different tones and their associated harmonics, a broadband
noise is identified as “hiss”, whose source mechanism is listed as related to
turbulence in the compressor stage. The frequency range of this turbulencerelated phenomenon is proposed as 0 – 20 kHz, but no further insight is
given.
A similar division was anticipated by Trochon [16], who classified turbocharger compressor noise in “pulsation noise” (the tonal noise caused by
the blade rotation) and “blow noise”, a broadband noise (named this way
for its resemblance to noise produced by a leakage). It is attributed by the
author to aerodynamic turbulence “inside the compressor” at high mass flow
and low shaft speed. By examining Fig. 1 of the reference we can assess the
presence of such a broadband noise between 1.5 and 2.5 kHz.
Evans and Ward [17] address explicitly the issue of a so-called “whoosh”
noise. This noise is identified as being “in general” of the broadband type.
The authors state that this noise is typically present from 750 Hz to in
excess of 10 kHz. they note however that most of the energy is apparently

2.1. Experimental research

|

21

distributed between 1.5 and 3 kHz. This appears to be similar to the “hiss”
noise mentioned in the previous reference, but in this case the authors point
out that the occurrence of whoosh appears to be specifically associated with
operation close to surge. In this situation, blade stall, reverse flow and
recirculation of intake air generate increased turbulence.
Raitor and Neise [26] mention instead the so-called “tip clearance noise”
(TCN), referring to a noise with narrow band spectral components below
the blade passing frequency (BPF). A similarity is drawn with the work of
Kameier and Neise [30] regarding axial turbo compressors, where a rotating
instability linked to stall cell propagation is discussed. This TCN is marked
in Fig. 8 of the reference as located between 3 kHz and 5.5 kHz in the inlet
duct. BPF is also marked in the figure, including its harmonics. An intense
“buzz-saw” multi-tonal noise is apparent at higher speeds in the inlet, but
not so in the outlet (see Fig. 10 of the reference). A TCN band appears in
the outlet duct as well. Mach speed at the impeller tip is also highlighted as
signalling the transition between TCN and BPF being the dominant source
mechanism. Further on, the appearance of buzz-saw noise in the inlet
appears to be marked by the transition from transonic to supersonic regime.

Chapter 2. Literature review

Following the work of Evans and Ward, Teng and Homco [4] obtained
further insight on the precise location of the whoosh noise for their setup.
Especially, in Fig. 5 of the reference it can be seen that whoosh noise appears
clearly in the 4.5 to 7 kHz band. BPF tone is not seen on the figure, which
is limited to a maximum frequency of 10 kHz. This suggests that BPF is
either of higher frequency, a condition which for the kind of compressor
described would be normal, thus indicating that this narrow band noise is
again below this frequency. In order to confirm the relation between surge
inception and whoosh noise, a type K thermocouple was affixed very close
to the compressor inlet. An apparent correlation between temperature rise
and 5 to 7 kHz sound pressure content is found in Fig. 7 of the reference,
suggesting that the presence of hot back-flow air due blade stall is related
to the identified whoosh noise.
Guillou et al [22] do not directly address the noise spectra in their study.
Nonetheless, the authors plot the pressure FFT in the outlet duct for various
flow regimes. It can be seen in Fig. 7, specially in the lower right plot
(stable regime), how a clear narrow band appears between 2 and 7 kHz.
This narrow band continues to be present in both stall and surge regimes,
but it is vastly made irrelevant by the strong low frequency signals that are
typical of surge.
Lee et al [21] focus their work on “pulsation noise”, asserting that it is
caused by unbalance of shaft and blades, and BPF noise, caused by the cyclic
motion of the blades. Its harmonics are also observed and mentioned (see
Figs. 9 and 10 of the reference). The authors also observe a “narrow band
noise” in the same figures, but they argue that, since it was not reported
by the turbocharger manufacturer, it can be dismissed as caused by the
experimental setup. Note that this narrow band noise appeared in this case
between 3 and 4.25 kHz. Interestingly, it was also present even when the
compressor was running without inlet and outlet ducts (see Fig. 11 of the
reference).
Tiikoja et al [29] revisit the topic making again a distinction between two
contributing phenomena. Stationary distortions are identified as leading
to periodic tones. Given an absence of inflow disturbances these tones are
referred to as rotor-alone tonal noise. Fluctuating pressure fields caused
by the interaction of inlet and outlet guide vanes and the rotor is regarded
as a secondary source which will introduce tonal noise at harmonics of the
BPF. On the other hand, a wide band noise is ascribed to non-stationary
disturbances (turbulence), but its importance for turbochargers is dismissed.
Denomination of buzz-saw noise for the tonal phenomena is used and at-

tributed to rotating shock waves attached to the blades whose tips reach
supersonic conditions. TCN is also named and marked as such in the results,
appearing in this case between 5 and 10 kHz in the outlet and between 4
and 7.5 kHz in the inlet, again below the BPF tone clearly visible at 12 kHz
(see Fig. 13 of the reference).

Similar results were obtained by Figurella et al
[23]. Discrete sound peaks (tones) were cited as

the dominant phenomena, located at synchronous 10

of the spectrogram in Fig. 6 of the reference seems to
suggest, however, that if whoosh noise was indeed present at the measured
operating condition, its frequency location was between 4 and 5 kHz.
In synthesis, two different phenomena are consistently identified in the
literature about turbocharger compressors. One consists of the tonal noises
linked to the rotation of the wheel. In order to work, compressor blades

24

|

Chapter 2. Literature review

must maintain a pressure difference between their pressure and suction
sides. This creates rotating pressure differences, being the rotation of the
blades the mechanism imposing the frequency. Harmonics of this frequency
may appear, especially in transonic or supersonic conditions where shock
waves attach to the blades, thus creating more rotating pressure gradients.
On the other hand, there is sufficient evidence of a recurrent broadband
noise at frequencies below the BPF, having been reported between 1.5 and
7.5 kHz, as seen in Fig. 2.1. In contrast with BPF tonal noise, there is
no clear mechanism proposed as being the cause of this phenomenon. As
seen above, some authors ascribe it to just “turbulence”, others to stalled
backflow interaction (including modal resonance), tip clearance effects, etc.
It is apparent that further research is needed to clarify this issue.

2.2. Numerical simulations
Given the clues about the relationship between this broadband noise and
three-dimensional flow effects in and near the compressor impeller, and at
the same time the difficulties of their accurate experimental characterization,
it is worth considering the numerical simulation of the problem through
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).

2.3. Influence of inlet geometry

CHAPTER 3

Measurement methodology
As stated in the prior chapter, one of the main objectives of the present work
has been to develop and implement robust measurement methodologies for
the acoustical characterization of turbocharger compressors.
In this chapter the theoretical background of these methodologies will be
presented, along with the details of their practical implementation and a
brief review of the facilities at where they have been implemented.
Apart from the purely experimental implementation, the step-by-step signal
processing required to produce final, compiled results will be introduced as
well, including sample results in order to illustrate each step.
Special care will be put in considering the different theoretical and practical
limitations and restrictions of experimental measurements and processing
techniques, to ensure that results are significant and robust.

3.1. Facilities
Most of the experimental work presented in this thesis has been carried
out at laboratory 5K of Universitat Politècnica de València. This facility is
equipped with two main installations.
The first one is a flow bench powered by a Diesel engine linked to an
asynchronous brake and a screw compressor. This flow bench can be configured to function as a turbocharger test stand or to provide air flow to other
facilities. Subsection 3.1.1 will be dedicated to an extended description of
this installation.
Next to the flow bench, there is a large anechoic chamber that can be
configured to either receive external air flow from the flow bench or to
host a standalone engine by itself. For this project, air was provided by

the flow bench when the turbocharger test stand was installed inside the
chamber. This arrangement is illustrated by Fig. 3.1, while subsection 3.1.2
will describe in detail this particular chamber.
Additionally, an engine test cell located on laboratory 6D has been used for
the on-engine validation tests described on chapter 5, where the inlet intake
of a commercial engine was modified to measure the compressor acoustic
emission.
Other facilities included an impulse test bench that was used for sensor calibration, and a workshop were the required customized parts for measuring
and instrumenting were manufactured.

3.1.1. Flow test rig
The flow test rig has been used as flow provider to power the turbocharger
turbine both directly, with the turbocharger installed in the flow rig cell itself
and, as shown in Fig. 3.1, with the turbocharger mounted in a supporting
frame inside the anechoic chamber.

3.1. Facilities

27

At the core of the rig there is a heavy duty MIDR 06.20.45 Diesel engine able
to provide up to 260 kW of power. This engine is linked to an asynchronous
electromagnetic brake and, through a coupling gear, to an Atlas Copco ZA
110-3.5 volumetric screw compressor. An overview of the whole installation
can be seen on Fig. 3.2.
Purpose of this compressor is twofold. First, it supercharges the Diesel
engine as its original turbocharger group was removed. Second, compressed
flow can be routed to either a turbocharger installed in the same cell or to
the adjacent chambers.
Another possibility of this test rig is to directly feed the exhaust gases of
the engine to an external turbocharger. This is the reason why the original
turbocharger was removed during installation. Direct flow will contain
the pulsating content of the engine, allowing simulation of real engine
conditions. The number of cylinders firing can be selected from 1 to 6 in
order to simulate different pulsating content. Also, if the hot exhaust gas
is desired but the pulsations are not, flow can be routed through a settling
tank that will smooth them out, resulting in continuous flow.

brake with its support cabinet, screw compressor and air distribution system,

Chapter 3. Measurement methodology

For the studies carried out in this facility during the development of this
thesis, pulsating flow was not selected. Continuous flow was used in both
the test rig and the anechoic chamber. However, work presented in chapter 5
used real engine conditions to validate the proposed techniques and obtained
results.
As for the flow control, another reservoir equipped with a discharging
valve can be used to distribute the compressed air between the engine inlet
manifold and the external circuit, which can be either directed to another
chamber or vented to the outside ambient through a silencer.
If cold flow is desired, a water intercooler can be used to lower the temperature produced by the compression process. This temperature, along with
the rest of flow properties like mass flows, pressures and other temperatures,
are recorded through a dedicated control system.
Engine and brake are controlled though their own independent instrumentation, while the instantaneous test turbocharger variables, including those
needed for acoustical characterization, are recorded through a dedicated
high speed Yokogawa DAQ.

3.1.2. Anechoic chamber
The anechoic chamber at laboratory 5K is a solid 9.5 × 9 × 7.2 m reinforced
concrete structure, isolated from the rest of the building and resting on a
waterproof support that dampens outside vibrations.
The internal walls of the chamber are completely covered in fiberglass
wedges of 0.8 m of longitude and a square base of 0.2×0.2 m. These wedges
leave an interior space of 7.5 × 6.5 × 6 m. Usually a further 1 m in each
direction is left as an additional safety margin, the rest of the volume being
equivalent to acoustic free field conditions.
Such free field conditions, where no acoustic reflection of the walls occurs,
are certified in this chamber up to a cut-off frequency of 100 Hz. Low
frequency waves may start to reflect below this limit.
A lightweight, acoustically-transparent, grated metallic floor is situated
over the floor wedges, supporting personnel and light equipment. Four
round steel pillars affixed to the concrete floor are available to support heavy
loads such as engines.
During the work described in this thesis, the load-bearing pillars were unused, since the turbocharger frame was lightweight enough to be supported
by the grated floor. Figure 3.3 shows the test turbocharger installed on this
frame.

Figure 3.3: View of the inside of the anechoic chamber, showing the turbocharger frame and the pipes required to operate the installation. White
wedges are removable if semi-anechoic operation is desired.

In order to allow the operation of the turbocharger, compressed air flow
is fed to the turbine from the flow rig described in the prior subsection.
The turbine discharges to a reservoir equipped with a conical nozzle that
decreases velocity and acoustic emissions.
Meanwhile, the compressor takes ambient air from the chamber, while its
exhaust is redirected to the adjacent auxiliary room for discharging, as seen
in Fig 3.1. A closed-loop lubricating oil system is also present. Water is also
provided to the cooling jackets of the sensors that require it, specially those
located on the turbine pipes and the compressor outlet.
A control system similar to that of the flow rig monitors the operation
of the system and gathers operational data (pipe temperatures, pressures,
mass flow, compressor speed, etc.), allowing regulation of oil temperature,
and compressor operation settings (speed and mass flow). Scientific data
(mainly dynamic pressure) is recorded with a Yokogawa high speed DAQ.

3.1.3. Engine test cell
As mentioned early in the chapter, while most of the experimental work
was carried out using the two facilities described already, the measurement
methodology was later put to the test on an engine test cell to ensure its
robustness and consistency on real engine conditions.

30

Chapter 3. Measurement methodology

Figure 3.4: View of the inside of the engine test cell with the engine in its
default configuration, before being modified for the acoustic measurements
described in chapter 5.

The test cell is equipped with an asynchronous electromagnetic brake that
allows both steady and transient automatic testing. Operative parameters
and control for the engine and brake are integrated into a custom system,
including gravimetric fuel consumption sensors, hot plate anemometers,
emission measurements and temperature and pressure control of the air
pipes and coolant flows.
Access and online control of the engine ECU is also available, and a special
pneumatic system can be used to inject compressed air into the inlet manifold
downstream the compressor.
This air injection reduces the air that the compressor needs to ingest,
thus lowering compressor air flow and allowing the control of this relevant
parameter independently of the engine necessities. The system was used to
bring the compressor to surge and near-surge conditions during our research.
In order to implement and validate the in-duct acoustical measurement
methodology presented in this chapter, additional sensors and equipment
were fitted into the test cell, including a Yokogawa high speed DAQ and a
Brüel & Kjær PULSE DAQ system with a pressure-pressure sound intensity
probe used as reference.

3.2. In-duct noise measurement [Article expMethod - rewrite]
As competition from alternative-powered vehicles and environmental concerns increase, traditional internal combustion engines for automotive applications are facing tougher scrutiny by regulators and consumers.

Requirements for lower pollutant emissions (such as NOx , CO, particulate
matter, etc.) and higher efficiency (in order to reduce production of CO2 )
are becoming more restrictive. An overview of these upcoming regulations is
available from Op de Beeck et al [1]. Consumers are also sensitive to the NVH
(noise, vibration, harshness) performance of vehicles, and to the adverse
impact of automotive emissions (including noise pollution), as shown by
Brizon and Bauzer [5].
In order to match these expectations automotive engines are heavily downsized in terms of displacement and number of cylinders. As these engines
are still required to provide equivalent levels of torque and power output,
turbocharging requirements have increased. Further discussion in downsizing, turbocharging and its importance to meet stricter emission policies is
available in the work of Schumann et al [2].
However, it should be noted that this strategy is not without consequences.
Stoffels and Schroeer [3] have shown how at certain operating conditions a
downsized engine can radiate higher noise levels than its larger displacement
equivalent.
An important contributor to engine noise radiation is the turbocharger
compressor, as it operates at conditions close to its limiting surge line [4]
due to increased turbocharging requirements.
However, increased noise quantity is not the only concern: it is also very
relevant to take into account the frequency in which the noise increases,
regarding attenuation possibilities as well as psychoacoustic perception of
“sound quality” by the consumer, as shown in the above cited study [5] and
in that of González et al [31].
In this paper, a methodology is proposed to evaluate the noise emission of
the compressor through its inlet and outlet pipes across selected zones of
the compressor map of operating conditions. It allows a simple and clear
visualization of noise phenomena and their frequency distributions at all
possible operation points of the turbocharger system.
Although compressor manufacturers sometimes provide these noise maps
[25], they usually refrain from providing an adequately referenced and
step-by-step methodology to reproduce them.
Reviewing the existing literature on turbocompressor noise a variety of
very different measurement techniques can be found, from the two-sensor,
in-duct approach of Tiikoja et al [29] to simple single-sensor pressure levels
and external commercial noise-meters [23].

Chapter 3. Measurement methodology

However, these works focus on the research of different phenomena (transmission loss [29], effect of flow incidence angle [23], sound generation by
rotating stall [9], source characterization [10], etc.), not on the acoustical
methodology itself nor on the particular setup considerations and restrictions
that each measurement technique imposes.
This work wishes to address these shortcomings of the existing literature
by proposing an experimental methodology and discussing the details of its
theoretical background, its implementation, its range of application, and
the processing required to produce standardized results.
In order to provide some illustrative results, the methodology proposed in
this paper has been applied to a series of experimental tests in a flow bench
where a small automotive turbocharging group has been installed.

to a Direction of Arrival (DOA) of θ .

It is important to consider that the scalar magnitude of sound pressure
level at a point can be influenced by the precise geometry of that section
and by nodes and reflections that may occur in the duct, whereas sound
intensity is a vectorial magnitude that remains almost constant along the
duct (except for small dissipation losses), making it a more robust indicator
of noise emission.

3.2. In-duct noise measurement [Article expMethod - rewrite]

33

The basis of such intensity measurement methods is to consider that
the pressure signal x(t) measured at a given point of a duct is the linear
superposition of a pressure wave x + travelling downstream and another
pressure wave x − travelling upstream (sometimes referred to as forward
and backward waves, respectively [32]) so that:
x(t) = x + (t) + x − (t)

(3.2.1)

Comparing the pressure information at two or moWhile it is possible [23]
to rely on a single sensor to measure the scalar sound pressure level (SPL) of
the flow at a certain location of a duct, more sophisticated approaches are
needed to estimate the sound intensity level (SIL) that is propagating through
the duct. re spatial positions it is thus possible to infer how the waves are
propagating along the duct in each direction, a possibility unavailable by
means of a single sensor.
When using this wave decomposition approach, the sound intensity can be
estimated following the expression proposed by Morfey [33] and successfully
derived by Dokumaci [34] from physical principles:
I=

1
|X+ |2 (1 + M )2 − |X− |2 (1 − M )2
ρa

(3.2.2)

Here X+ and X− are, respectively, the complex spectra of the downstream
and upstream pressure waves, ρ is the mean density, a the mean sound
speed, and M the mean Mach number of the flow.

3.2.1.2. Wave decomposition
For a more intuitive comprehension of the beamformer, one can consider its
transmitting equivalent: a phased array emitter where the same signal x(t),
with its phase shifted by a quantity w∗n , is fed to an n-element linear array of
fixed transmitters, forming a plane wave emitted in the θ direction which
can be steered at will adjusting each w∗n . The beamforming method provides
a way to mathematically tune the sensitivity of the overall system in order
to isolate the downstream and upstream information of the acquired signal.
A scheme for a narrowband beamformer can be found in Fig. 3.5.
The approach in this paper is the inverse: by tuning the weights w∗n that
multiply each recorded pressure signal x n (t) the pressure wave coming from
the direction of arrival (DOA) θ that we are interested in may be resolved.
Details can be found in [35].

34

Chapter 3. Measurement methodology

The extension to a wideband beamformer is relatively straightforward
[36]. First the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT, denoted by ) of the recorded
pressure signals is computed:
Xn ( f k ) =

{x n (t k )}

(3.2.3)

Subscript k indicates that the signal is acquired at discrete time steps.
The described narrowband procedure is then followed for each discrete
frequency to finally obtain the desired signal through the inverse transform:
−1

x(t) =

wH ( f k ) X( f k )

(3.2.4)

Here, X( f k ) is the k × n matrix of transformed signals and wH ( f k ) is the
matrix of weights for each frequency. In order to compute the optimal
weights for the desired DOAs (θ = −90o for downstream and θ = 90o for
upstream waves, assuming a typical flow DOA of θ = 90o ), several schemes
can be used.
For this study a Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance (LCMV) beamformer was used, a well established procedure, which aims at minimizing
the overall output power (variance) of the signal, while maintaining unitary
gain in the precise desired direction.

Chapter 3. Measurement methodology

3.2.2. Experimental procedure
3.2.2.1. Turbocharger instrumentation
The correct design and installation of the fast pressure sensor arrays is a
critical part of the experimental setup.
Ideally, the sensors should be mounted flush (with water-cooled adapters
if necessary) in straight pipes, with diameters adjusted to preserve the cross
sectional area of the adjacent duct in order to avoid complex structures
caused by singularities.
As a further measure, enough straight clearance should be left before and
after the array (as shown on figure 5.1), to ensure essentially plane wave
flow at the measurement section [37]. There should be a minimum of 6
diameters upstream of the array and a further 4 diameters downstream, as
recommended in [38].
When placing the transducers, it is important that the 1/5 and 1/3 nodes of
the established standing wave pattern are avoided [39]. Also, a compromise
in the spacing ds between them must be reached, taking into consideration
errors in the low-frequency [40] and high-frequency [41] bands.
Specially, it should be noted that spatial aliasing effects will occur above
the Nyquist frequency imposed by the spacing ds . The time of arrival of
a wave with DOA θ and speed a to two consecutive sensors spaced by a
distance ds is:
ds sin θ
(3.2.5)
Td =
a
This imposes a Nyquist-type frequency criterion, as the measured wave
frequency f n should be maximum half the frequency f d = 1/Td naturally
associated with Td to ensure that no high frequency spatial aliasing effects
are present:

A further restricting phenomenon is the acoustic mode propagation. As
the beamforming method proposed is based on the assumption of onedimensional wave propagation, it will become unreliable with the onset of
3D effects.
According to Eriksson [42], it may be assumed that waves in a circular
duct propagate in a planar fashion (i.e., pressure is constant in every crosssectional area of the duct) below a cut-off frequency of:
f a = 1.84

Here, a is the sound speed, D the duct diameter and M the mean Mach
number. At higher frequencies, the so-called first asymmetric mode will start
to propagate, thus rendering the assumption of one-dimensional propagation
invalid.
Special care should be taken when computing limiting frequencies f n and
f a as they are not constant but dependent on the operating condition, since
some of their components vary with temperature and mass flow. Figure 3.8
shows both limits for a certain operating point.
As the figure shows, the Nyquist criterion accurately pinpoints where differences between sensors start to grow, and it is clearly a more restrictive
criterion than the acoustic mode onset. This limit should be properly computed for each condition when multi-sensor decomposition techniques are
used.
Also, figure 3.8 shows other phenomena, for instance the peak related to
the passing of each rotor blade, usually known as Blade Passing Frequency
(BPF) in the literature [26], which is marked as such in the figure:
BPF ∼ 160 krpm / 60

s
× 6 main blades ∼ 16 kHz
min

(3.2.8)

It is also important to note that the closer the sensors are mounted together
for increasing the f n limit, the poorer the spatial resolution of low frequency
waves will be, as the wavelengths λ = a/ f become too long and the difference between consecutive sensors decreases below the noise threshold. This
effect is intrinsically related to each particular sensor model, but it must be
considered if very low frequencies are of interest.
Finally, it is essential to ensure that the response of the three sensors of
each array is coherent. Before mounting the sensors in the final linear array
form, they should be mounted radially in the same section of a duct and
individually calibrated, to ensure that the difference between sensors is not
due to individual transducer differences, but only to wave propagation.
In this case, the calibration is performed in an impulse test rig (described in
detail in [43]) so as to obtain a clear reference pressure wave in all sensors.
Both the time and frequency responses are observed, and both the amplifier
offset and gain are adjusted to find the best match. An example can be seen
on figure 3.9.
In addition to the fast pressure sensors data, more information is required
to compile the compressor operating conditions map. These maps are usually
presented as plots of the operation points on a total-to-total pressure ratio

3.2.2.2. Steady state measurements
The usual approach for measuring the operating points of the compressor
map involves reducing the air flow by progressively closing the back-pressure
valve (shown in figure 5.1) until the desired air mass flow is reached, while
the turbine power is adjusted to preserve a given corrected compressor speed
(N ∗ ) and to achieve stable operation conditions.
Eventually the compressor blades will begin to stall, until a deep surge
condition is reached, as shown in the left plot of figure 3.10. In order to
avoid this destructive condition, the valve will be opened again and another
constant corrected regime line will be measured, until the desired region of
the compressor map is completely covered.
Several reference conditions can be selected when correcting the speed
and the air mass flow; in this study the mean sea level standard day (defined
as one of 15ºC of temperature and 1 atm of pressure) of the International
Standard Atmosphere will be used:

3.2.2.3. Surge limit characterization
When measuring a turbocharger operation map, it is particularly important to characterize accurately the surge limit, especially when an acoustic
evaluation is sought out [44].
In order to measure different mass flows, the back-pressure valve is usually
closed slowly until a certain surge criterion is met, and then opened to
avoid damaging the turbocharger. Several surge criteria for centrifugal
turbomachinery have been proposed in the literature, for tests on flow
benches [44] and on engine test rigs [45].
An average of power spectrum of a single pressure sensor in the 0 to 20
Hz range, shown by Galindo et al [44] to be a good surge indicator, was
computed once for discrete time steps T of 0.5 seconds, providing a clear

that indicates surge onset.

3.2.2.4. Signal postprocessing: maps and spectrograms
In addition to the intensity spectra determined for each operating point,
further results can be obtained by applying an interpolation procedure to
the spectra associated with all the points tested.
For instance, it is possible to calculate the overall level of sound intensity
for a given frequency range at each operating point i of the compressor
operating map. The sound intensity level at a characteristic band (between
f1 and f2 ) can be calculated for each point as:
f2

L i = 10 log10 10

12

I 2( f )

(3.2.12)

f = f1

Once that several L i levels have been measured for different conditions of
a selected map region, a cubic spline interpolation function Φ f1 − f2 is used to
project the data onto a much more fine and regularly spaced grid, allowing
the representation of a map of noise intensity across the measured region of
the compressor map, as shown in figure 3.11.
These “noise maps” synthesize the information of the acoustic output of a
frequency band of interest in a simple and visual result, allowing an easy
estimation of the noise emission through desired operating conditions even
if these have not been specifically measured.

42

Chapter 3. Measurement methodology

Expanding on the necessity of analysing the frequency content evolution
as the operating conditions of the compressor change, a different approach
can be used, where the measured discrete information can be compiled to
estimate a continuous spectrogram.
This is accomplished by sequentially performing the previous map processing for a number N of much smaller frequency bands of width ∆ f , resulting
in a collection of N interpolation functions Φ f j − f j+1 , where f j+1 − f j = ∆ f .
Using these functions, the intensity levels L on each small frequency band
k are interpolated for a set of M pairs of the compressor map coordinates,
such that:
_ ∗ , ˝TT )
L j = Φ f j − f j+1 (m

(3.2.13)

An estimation of the spectrogram S that would be obtained in a quasi_ ∗ , ˝TT )
stationary measurement by following the set of operation conditions (m
pairs can then be compiled gathering the levels L j . Choosing one coordinate

Thus the sound intensity level value S for each m∗ and each frequency

3.2.3. Results and discussion
In order to illustrate the methodology presented in this paper, the evaluation
of a small automotive turbocompressor was carried out in a flow bench,
configured as shown in figure 5.1.
Kistler type 7031 piezoelectric transducers were used for the inlet duct;
the outlet duct was fit with type 6031 transducers due to available stock.
An array spacing ds = 32 mm for the outlet and ds = 50 mm for the inlet
was selected, allowing for a safe upper limit in terms of the spatial Nyquist
criterion f n of ∼6000 and ∼3500 Hz respectively (precise values depend on
the conditions of each point).

The variables needed in order to characterize the map point (mass flow,
speed, temperatures and pressures) were averaged during 30 seconds, while
the six piezoelectric sensors acquired 105 pressure samples during 1 second
using a Yokogawa digital recorder.
Pressure signals on recorded points (shown in figure 3.10) were then
processed according to the proposed methodology. Samples of the final
results are presented in figures 3.11 and 3.12.
Figure 3.11 shows the 1 – 3 kHz sound intensity level distribution across
selected operating conditions, approximately between maximum efficiency
and the measured surge limit.
Noise in this frequency band is sometimes designated as “whoosh” noise
in the literature, and is of particular concern for automotive manufacturers,
as the user may perceive negatively this particular frequency. Indeed, the
user expects a low frequency engine sound instead of a high-pitched one.
Another point of concern that has been identified in the results is that the
relevance of this particular phenomenon extends far from the surge region
and well into the expected engine operation region.
In fact, looking at either the 160 krpm line on figure 3.11 or at the expanded
spectrograms of this line in figure 3.12 where this band has been marked,
there is a local maximum in this band between 60 and 70 g/s. For the 180
krpm points on the map of figure 3.11, the “whoosh” noise may be heard
even for up to 80 g/s mass flow rate.
Apart from “whoosh”, both spectrograms show a clear rise in low frequency
content when the mass flow is reduced and surge conditions start to appear,
even if deep surge conditions have not yet been reached. This is consistent
with spectrograms measured experimentally by Galindo et al [46].
Furthermore, this kind of low frequency band may be plotted and its
distribution compared with other bands, as shown in figure 3.13 where
three different frequency limits have been applied to equation 3.2.12 during
signal processing.
Compared with the global distribution of sound intensity in the plane wave
range (left plot), the “whoosh noise” band (central plot) appears to be more
prevalent at higher pressure ratios, while the low frequency content (right
plot) is characteristic of surge onset.
These observations match the trends observed in the literature [17, 18,
47]. Other frequency bands could be mapped in a similar manner, and
spectrograms estimated for different map paths with no need to repeat the
experimental measurements, in order to investigate other phenomena of
interest or to test several candidates for actual engine operating lines.

Chapter 3. Measurement methodology

3.2.4. Conclusions
In this paper a detailed experimental methodology for the noise evaluation
of turbocharger compressors in flow benches [48] or engine test cells [49]
is proposed and demonstrated.
It is based on a robust in-duct acoustical beamforming technique that
resolves the plane wave range sound intensity, by decomposing the total
pressure signal into its upstream and downstream components.
In addition to resolving intensity, another advantage of the wave decomposition technique is the possibility of isolating the pressure data coming
from the compressor, in order to simulate an anechoic duct termination
in situations where actual anechoic setups are not feasible (due to valves,
filters, and other elements).
This isolated pressure information is also useful to validate or initialize
CFD simulations where the model boundary conditions have to be defined as
anechoic because simulating accessories (valves, flexible ducts, etc.) is not
worthy or desirable. Such a validation methodology is presented in [50].
When used to evaluate the acoustic intensity of the noise generated by
the compressor, the proposed signal processing allows easily to understand
visual representations in the form of noise maps of selected frequency bands
of interest and estimated spectrograms of operating paths. This can provide
guidelines for the evaluation of strategies to counter or avoid certain adverse
noise phenomena.
The examples presented above illustrate how this technique allows detecting known acoustical phenomena of a centrifugal compressor, such as
medium frequency “whoosh noise” and low frequency surge onset, as well as
mapping its distribution and relevance across different operating conditions
of the turbocharger.
In addition to offering the detailed measurement and signal processing
steps, this paper stresses the importance of taking into account restrictive
factors such as calibration, sensor setup clearances and locations, frequency
aliasing effects and ranges in which theoretical assumptions hold in order
to obtain robust and reproducible results.
The technique presented here should provide researchers who need to
evaluate turbocharger compressor noise emission with a means to focus
their efforts on the acoustical phenomena instead of on the measurement
itself, thus allowing to further advance knowledge on this topic.

Recall that decomposed signals for each frequency f k are obtained by

as follows:

3.4. External noise measurements
While the accurate characterization of the internal sound field is vital to
understand the different phenomena, the transmission of the noise to the
ambient is also relevant as external acoustic radiation is ultimately the main
concern of the automotive industry.
To that extent, different external measurements have been carried out as
part of the experimental campaign. Noise data has been captured in the
orifice of the compressor inlet, around the far field of the turbocharger, and
along the radiating surfaces near field.
This section will describe how these measurement were made, while results
and discussion will be presented in section 4.2 of chapter 4. Section 4.3 of
the same chapter will show how this data correlates with internal noise field
measurements.

3.4.1. Orifice noise
Noise emitted by the open end of the compressor inlet duct is of special
concern, as it is the point where the internal sound field meets the exterior
ambient. Still, noise produced by the compressor travelling upstream the
inlet duct is not the only source in this case, as the flow noise produced by
the flow interaction produced by the aspiration process can be relevant as
well.
However, when measuring external noise care should be taken to avoid
reflections and perturbations that may interfere with the results. This is why
it was decided to install the turbocharger inside the anechoic chamber, so
that free field conditions could be recreated.
In this chamber, instrumentation consisted in two omnidirectional Brüel &
Kjær [model] microphones placed in front of the compressor inlet orifice,
both aligned with its axis and separated 10 cm and 20 cm from the aperture,
respectively.

3.4. External noise measurements

These microphones were calibrated before the measurements with a Brüel
& Kjær [model] pistonphone. Both the calibration and the data acquisition
were performed with a Brüel & Kjær PULSE system.
As the conditions inside the anechoic chamber can be regarded as being
equivalent to those of an acoustic free field, we can estimate the magnitude
of the sound intensity at each microphone i as:
|I i | =

Here, prms,i
is the root mean squared pressure recorded by microphone i, ρ

Taking advantage of the free field conditions of the chamber, ambient microphones were installed around the turbocharger group to estimate the far
field sound radiation.

To obtain a better estimation of the sound field, four omnidirectional
microphones were distributed around the the central point of the installation,
at a radial distance of 1 m from it, as shown on Fig. 3.14.
Data from these four microphones was captured using a Brüel & Kjær
PULSE system, and their calibration was also performed using a Brüel &
Kjær [model] pistonphone prior to the measurements.
In order to provide a global metric to compare against orifice noise, pressure recording for the four microphones was averaged.

5.1. Introduction
Turbomachinery-generated noise is nowadays one of the main concerns of
automotive engineering, either aerial or terrestrial, as industry and society
at large are today well aware of the many problems originated by acoustic
pollution.
Once exclusive to jet aircraft and high performance engines, the use of
turbomachinery is now widespread in internal combustion engines as a
result of the current trend to downsize engines [52], since otherwise it
would not be possible to maintain the same power output while reducing the
displacement. In order to achieve this, the compressor must provide higher
pressure ratios over a wide range of air mass flow, consequently operating in
zones close to its surge limit [53] and farther from its maximum efficiency
peak. At the same time it must provide the required mass flow without
overspeeding.
As a result of this demanding requirements, even if the control system
may assure the overall safety of the system, the noise generated by the
turbocharger is becoming a noticeable issue that also needs to be controlled
[31], either actively or passively. In fact, engine noise not only has negative
effects on the environment in terms of acoustic pollution, but can also cause
discomfort to vehicle passengers, as the engine noise quality is affected
[5, 6].

52 | Chapter 5. On-engine validation
[Article expMethod - rewrite]

For this reason, the acoustical characterization of the compressor across
critical or demanding operation zones or even across its entire operation
map becomes increasingly necessary, and several studies on compressor
noise characterization, analysis and mitigation can be found in the recent
literature [17, 54, 4].
In this paper, various procedures that enable the synthesis of this acoustic
information in the form of sound maps that cover a selected zone of the
compressor map for relevant frequency ranges are assessed. Such representations provide a simple and clear visualization of noise phenomena for the
possible operation points of the turbocharger in that zone.
An important consideration is that robust methodologies are needed to
perform this acoustic characterization in the environment of production
engine test cells, which are usually neither anechoic nor designed for acoustic
measurements.

5.2. Experimental characterization
In order to obtain a noise map that characterizes noise generation by the
compressor it is necessary to know the sound spectrum at several operating
points and then extract the level of the different frequency bands of interest.
Reviewing the available literature on noise characterization of rotating
machines, two different approaches are found. One of them is based on measuring radiated noise by means of exterior microphones inside an anechoic
environment as done, for instance, by Cudina [55]. In engine conditions,
however, it is difficult to separate the radiation of the compressor from the
engine noise.
The other approach focuses on in-duct noise [29], using fast pressure
sensors mounted flush inside the duct, in order to better identify the different
internal flow phenomena involved in the generation of compressor noise.
As this last approach can be more reliably applied to a non-anechoic engine
test, this investigation is focused on it.

5.2.1. In-duct noise measurements
Some authors [23] rely on a single sensor to estimate the in-duct signal
spectrum, whereas others use more sophisticated approaches introducing
more sensors [29]. While the one-sensor method allows the calculation of
sound pressure level (SPL), a scalar magnitude which only gives information

5.2. Experimental characterization

of the sum of all waves at a particular point, sound wave decomposition enables the computation of the sound intensity level (SIL), a vector magnitude
which offers information on the sound coming from a particular direction.
The basis of decomposition methods is to consider that the pressure signal
p measured at a given point of a duct is the linear superposition of a pressure
wave traveling forward in the flow direction, p+ , and another pressure wave
traveling backwards, p− . According to Morfey [33], the total intensity can
be regarded as the sum of the upstream and downstream pressure spectra
(ˆp+ and ˆp− ) corrected with the mean Mach number (M0 ) and characteristic
acoustic impedance (ρ0 a0 ):
I = I+ − I− =

ρ0 a0

ˆp+ (1 + M0 )2 − ˆp− (1 − M0 )2

(5.2.1)

In order to use this expression, it is thus necessary to select a measurement
system that allows for wave decomposition. One of the standards is the
two-microphone method used for example by Holland and Davies [37]
and Tiikoja et al. [29], which uses the correlated spectra measured by
two consecutive wall-flush mounted microphones to estimate the reflection
coefficient and thus resolve both waves.
However, the two-microphone method is not free of drawbacks. The
most important are the negative influence of interfering signals, which is
not considered with only two microphones [56], some viscothermal wave
attenuation effects [40] and incoherence of the forward and backward
signals, the last two being common in waves propagating in flows [57, 37].
Some of these problems can be addressed using another method denominated beamforming, based in phased sensor arrays, which has been successfully used for the study of acoustic and pressure fields in ducts with flow
[58, 59, 60].
The beamforming method can be applied to arrays of two or more microphones, weighting the signal of each one to “steer” the sensitivity of the
array in the direction of interest (in this case, upstream and downstream
of the pipe). A Linearly Constrained Minimum Covariance algorithm was
applied in this case to find such weights (see [32] for details).
The experimental installation includes thus an array of piezoelectric pressure sensors flush-mounted in an extension of the compressor inlet pipe.
These sensors were used to test the beam-forming method, the two-microphone
method, and the sound pressure level (SPL) of a single sensor. A commercial
intensity probe (B&K Type 4197) consisting of two phase-matched 1/2” mi-

crophones was also installed at the inlet mouth as a reference, surrounded
by acoustic insulation mats in order to avoid reflections from the walls or
other components. Fig. 5.1 shows this experimental setup.
Before applying the selected methods to the whole chart of the compressor,
it is necessary to evaluate the restrictions that they impose in the frequency
domain. While the SPL is only limited by the frequency response of the
particular sensor, the decomposition algorithms of both the two-microphone
method and the beamforming method present some common additional
restrictions.
The first one is that both methods are formulated considering plane wave
propagation, and are thus theoretically restricted to the frequency range
below the onset of higher order modes. According to Eriksson [42], the
cut-off frequencies for the first asymmetric and first radial modes can be
approximated by

being D the pipe diameter. Also, around 10 diameters of straight pipe
should be included at both sides of the array, and the nodes of the standing
waves corresponding to 1/3 and 1/5 of the pipe length must be avoided.
Another restriction is related to the spatial resolution of the consecutive
sensors [41], which imposes a cut-off frequency similar in concept to a
Nyquist limit for spatial (rather than temporal) sampling, based on the
separation (ds ) of the sensors. Above this frequency limit, erroneous spatial
aliasing effects will be introduced. A simple approximation for this criterion
is:
fasim =

Figure 5.2: Inlet in-duct sound spectra estimated by the three considered
methods (SPL, beamforming and two-microphone) and orifice sound intensity
spectrum as measured by the B&K intensity probe.

In the low frequency range, it is necessary to consider that at sufficiently
large wavelengths, the signal differences between consecutive sensors decrease below their sensitivity limit, invalidating the results. With the separator used between the microphones of the intensity probe this limit is at 250
Hz.
Fig. 5.2 shows the in-duct sound spectra computed with the three proposed
methods: SPL with one sensor, two-microphone approach, and beamforming
with three probes. The spectra measured at the orifice by the reference probe
is superimposed in black. In this region, the beamforming method appears
to follow the reference more closely.
It is also shown how spurious aliasing peaks occur at the frequency predicted by Eq. 5.2.3 when more than one sensor is used and how the onset of
the 1st radial mode predicted by Eq. 5.2.2 marks a clear difference between
the in-duct sound field and the sound field radiated by the inlet orifice.
The results of applying Eq. 5.2.1 to compute SIL in the plane wave region
of the spectra at different operating conditions of the compressor are shown
in Fig. 5.3. Absolute levels at each working point were interpolated in
order to get a continuous map. The beamforming and the two-microphone
methods were used for in-duct SIL estimation and the intensity probe for
measuring the reference orifice SIL. Correlations of these measurements
are also provided, showing that in the plane wave range the beamforming
method appears to perform up to 30% better in terms of R2 .

56 | Chapter 5. On-engine validation
[Article expMethod - rewrite]

Fig. 5.4 shows a comparison between the SPL computed by selecting only
one sensor of the array and the reference SIL of the probe. The correlation
of these two measurements is better in terms of R2 than the two-microphone
method but still worse than the beamforming method.
However, it should be noted that simple sound pressure level measurements
can be influenced by the complex geometry of actual production pipes, which
are remarkably more complex than the straight pipe used in this study. Also,
it can be seen in Fig. 5.4 that, while at low pressure the sound maps are

quite similar, SPL of one probe predicts a high sound level at high pressure
ratio and high mass flow conditions, which is not the case for the intensity
probe.
These high sound level points at high pressure ratio can be clearly seen
as points lying out-side the 95% observation confidence bounds of the
correlation in Fig. 5.4. A similar problem can be seen in the correlation
of the two-microphone method in Fig. 5.3, in which some outliers appear
to dis-tort the map at some operation zones. The beamforming method,
however, appears to be more robust.

5.2.2. Radiated noise measurement
Besides in-duct measurements, another acoustic characterization approach
consists in the measurement of noise radiated by the turbocharger and its
pipes, in most cases using free field microphones at a given distance from
the setup.
This method has the advantage of allowing measurements with the real
geometry, without any modification in the pipes to mount the in-duct measurement sensors. However, for accurate measurements it is desirable that
the test cell be anechoic in order to prevent disturbances in measurements
caused by reflections in the engine cell walls and resonances created by the
cavities of the engine or its ducts that appear as other noise sources.
As testing the whole engine setup requires a large and expensive anechoic
chamber, the setup is sometimes reduced to just the turbocharger group,
which is powered by an external compressor or electric motor, losing in this
way the possibility of performing on-engine tests.
However, a novel procedure based on measuring acoustic particle velocity
level (PVL) may solve these issues [61] and enable on-engine testing in
non-anechoic environments. This method makes use of two microscopic
filaments acting as hot-wire flowmeters. Measuring the small voltage drop
between the two, it is possible to derivate the acoustic particle velocity in
the plane of the sensor.
Such a method, in this case a commercial solution providing acoustic
holography-like maps of radiated noise level [62], has been tested on the
(non-anechoic) engine test cell. The measuring probe of this device houses
the two filaments on a MEMS chip and a traditional microphone, allowing the
comparison of the performance of acoustic particle velocity measurements
against traditional free-field sound pressure level (SPL) measurements.

Figure 5.5: Near field noise holograms (800–2000 Hz) obtained through SPL
(top) and PVL (bottom), including detail of the spectra of two regions of
interest: turbocharger group (blue) and compressor inlet (red).

Fig. 5.5 shows this comparison. SPL (top) and PVL (bottom) maps of the
measured engine environment are provided by tracking the probe along the
near field of the surfaces of interest. The frequencies considered in these
maps have been restricted to the 800–2000 Hz range, where it is common
that a broadband emission known as “whoosh noise” is produced by the
turbocharger [17]. For two particular regions (turbocharger group and inlet
duct, marked on the maps) the full pressure (top) and particle velocity
(bottom) spectra are also provided.
The particle velocity technique clearly distinguishes the turbocharger as
the source of an 800–2000 Hz broadband noise at this particular operating
condition, identified as whoosh noise. The pressure method also appears to
identify the turbocharger as the source, but the contrast with the surrounding
areas is much less pronounced. This can be clearly seen in the SPL spectra, in
which the level of this frequency band is similar in both zones (turbocharger
and inlet in this case). In the case of the PVL spectra the turbocharger
contribution is visibly higher.
However, the pressure method appears to be more sensitive to reflections
in the near field and was thus unable to provide a clear identification. It
should be noted that if characterization through in-duct techniques of this

particular whoosh noise is intended, special attention should be placed on
the outlet pipe, as this phenomenon is often found exclusively downstream
of the turbo-charger [50].

5.3. Conclusions
Characterization of the acoustic performance of a given compressor under
engine conditions must start with the definition of test means. If an anechoic
chamber capable of housing the entire engine is available, then free field
microphones can be used to estimate the acoustic radiation, but even in this
case it would be difficult to isolate the contribution of the compressor.
In order to quantify the compressor noise emission, an intensity probe can
be located at the inlet orifice. However, intensity probes are quite expensive,
and sufficient acoustic insulation is necessary to prevent reflections. Also,
characteristics of the internal field that are not externally propagated will
be lost.
In-duct noise measurements offer a cost-effective way to characterize the
sound field generated by the compressor, if the ducts can be modified so as
to include straight measurement sections. Single-sensor SPL may be used
to investigate the upper frequency bands, but generally sound intensity is
a better and more meaningful metric of the acoustic power output of the
source.
Calculation of in-duct sound intensity can be achieved by using an additional consecutive sensor and decomposing the waves through the twomicrophone method. However, the addition of a third sensor and the decomposition through the beamforming method appears to be more reliable
along the full plane wave range, and especially in the lower frequencies
(250–1000 Hz).
However, the restrictions of these intensity-based methods must be carefully considered, specially the influence of higher order modes and the
aliasing frequency limit introduced by the spatial sampling imposed by the
sensor spacing.
Regarding the external radiated noise, the particle velocity method has
been able to provide more contrast than the pressure method and to correctly
identify the turbocharger as the source of noise radiation at that particular
“whoosh noise” band, in accordance with previous experience.
The particle velocity method could therefore be useful to reconstruct noise
maps similar to those obtained using in-duct measurements, isolating the
signal from the acoustic near field of the area of interest at different working

conditions, without the need of modifying the original duct geometry or
ensuring anechoic conditions. More research is being carried out on this
topic.
